The world awaits Mr. Khrushchev's choice of alternatives .
But this year prospects may be better .
A good man departs .
He was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure ; ;
The demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical .
His leadership was not for audiences .
"A growl , a nod , was usually enough ."
And it was the House he loved .
He served `` with '' him .
He was a fighter for those of his own party .
"With Republican presidents , he fought fair ."
"He was his own man , not an automatic obstructionist ."

Meditations from a fallout shelter
A shock wave from Africa
His firm hand will be desperately missed .
Mr. Hammarskjold was in Africa on a mission of peace .
He earnestly urged a cease-fire .
The story of the fatal crash is not fully known .
He gave his life for his beliefs .
That is the hope of mankind .
Too many have bogged down in bickering .
So we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity .
The balance is being budgeted for the coming year .
Unanimity on Interama is not surprising .
County officials have cooperated consistently .
A short report and a good one
Each state advisory committee documented its own activity .
The progress reported by the advisory committee is real .
Inevitably this means some compromise .
The aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired .
"If he becomes chancellor , Dr. Erhart would make few changes ."
Regardless of the decision two facts are clear .

Self-criticism is a rare but needed commodity in Congress .

Public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is growing .
But that heritage is shrinking even faster .

That is one approach .
Many of our very best friends are reformers .
That might go over .
The Faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds .
His official term expired last summer .
This was juvenile ridicule .
It was the Eisenhower Administration which produced the largest peacetime deficit .

The U.N.'s ' gravest crisis '
Of course it is .
What the new charter does
There is no such magic in man-made laws .
but the City Council will now share fully this budget-altering power .
The Controller retains his essential `` fiscal watchdog '' functions ; ;
his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed .
Some fiscal changes are important .
This will have a beneficial effect by expediting public business ; ;
it will also correct some injustices .
In such conditions all freedoms are lost .
He felt able to end on a note of hope .
Dr. Conant's call to action
Dr. Conant has come away shocked and angry .
Dr. Conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality .
But these are side issues to a powerful central theme .
"That theme cuts through hypocrisies , complacency and double-talk ."
These warnings must not be treated lightly .
"Dr. Conant's conscientious , selfless efforts deserve the nation's gratitude ."

Letter writing is a dying art .
"Old , tired , trembling the woman came to the cannery ."

Threat of closing the cannery is a recent one .
It helps those people who help themselves .

The evening was not always spent in the same way .
The little cottage was bursting with people of all ages .

Would the driver see the turtle ? ?
Would he take pains to avoid it ? ?
Mr. Podger took no chances .
Where was the driver now ? ?
What was he doing ? ?
And the turtle ? ?
Then there had been the auction itself .
Mr. Podger heard again ; ;

It was part of a citywide move toward full integration .
There are many causes for this change .

It's the same with Ron Hansen and Jim Gentile .
They shouldn't be asked to carry any more of the burden .
But they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production .
Don't ask him more .
I have a hunch Marv Breeding might move up a notch .
And the pitching will also have trouble doing better .

"As of now , that all seems behind him ."
He's been entirely different all spring .
) Did his mother make him this way ? ?
Some people believe she did .
A mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties .
But we don't think she creates them .
He wants me to do everything for him .
"But I do and my psychiatrist does , too ."
`` One thing I notice which I have seldom heard mentioned .
Physical contact is uncomfortable for him '' ! !
This mother is quite correct .
Parents have to find other ways of comforting him .
Only ingenuity will uncover it .
I try to give him as many normal experiences as possible .
`` What is your experience with autistic children ? ?
How do they turn out later '' ? ?
Many autistic children grow up to lead relatively normal lives .
Should I show my daughter how things should be colored ? ?
"She is an aggressive , nervous child ."

This breaks his heart .
But even mother's loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior .
What can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior ? ?

She can remove all knick-knacks within reach .
She tells him of the consequences of his behavior .
Remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior .

The first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself .
That dilemma is as much with us as ever .

The occasion was sentimental ; ;
so was the playing .
So was the audience .
What a man this Petipa was ! !
Vadim Kalentiev was the conductor .
It was quite an evening ! !
He traveled alternately with Mr. Kennedy and with Richard M. Nixon .
This is a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting one .
And as an introduction to American politics it is highly educational .
Mr. White is bluntly frank in his personal opinions .
he trusts only himself and his wife .
the least inspiring candidate since Alfred M. Landon '' .
Every decision was made quickly on sound grounds .
Efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance .
And he makes many interesting comments .
The years suddenly fell away at this point .
What sets Negro-appeal programing apart from other radio shows ? ?

The exhibition presents all phases of Sloan's many-sided art .
"Not all the paintings , however , are of cities ."
but no amount of head-tossing could make it so .
"His was a burgomaster's Beethoven , solid and sensible ."
This theory eventually proved inexact .
Dr. Whitrow functioned as moderator .
Professor Bondi disagrees with the expansion-contraction theory .
This would give the hydrogen atom a slight charge-excess .
Now for the good points .
More than half the audience departed .
Others huddled under the trees outside the fence .
The heavens refused to give up their weeping .
But the final scenes could not be played .
`` Much Ado '' ends happily .
Still a demurrer or two must be entered .
"Schwarzkopf is , of course , Schwarzkopf ."
The symptoms Saturday night were unmistakable .
Miss Schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them .
"There was , additionally , a bonus for the Saturday-night patrons ."
`` Perhaps it is better to stay at home .

"Off Grand Isle , yachters often visit the towering oil rigs ."
River cruising for small craft is ideal in November .
"He is a dull , unformed , and aimless person ; ;"
His treatment of it is something else .

Perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal .

"Clerfayt is neurotic , preoccupied , and passive ."

"The west is leaderless , according to this book ."
But these Western countries do care about themselves .
Each feels intensely national .
Montgomery believes that she started well .
America has divided more than she has united the West .
The path to leadership is made clear .
`` The West should make the central proposal ; ;
Whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous path to leadership .
"However , Montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory and practice ."
"Like Eisenhower , he holds the militarist's suspicion of politicians ."
Now big forces buffet food .
Not all the concern for health is well directed .
Out of cholesterol come Keys's main messages so far :
Americans eat too much .
Americans eat too much fat .
Obesity : a malnutrition .
He is particularly vulnerable to diabetes .
Physical exercise raises the appestat .
So does cold weather .
"`` Metrecal is a pretty complete food '' , he says ."
"`` It contains large amounts of protein , vitamins and minerals ."
They know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones .
"Eventually , says Keys , one of two things happens ."
But fatty foods do .
Saturated fats can accommodate no more hydrogens .
"All this has not , however , been an unmixed blessing ."
We marvel at their blindness for not seeing this .
Even Mr. Miller himself seems uncertain on this score .
And his belief is not to his discredit .
Surely this is a reality we all acknowledge .
"We cannot , of course , assign it any substance ."
One characteristic of the spirit in community is its givenness .
But this statement is completely unconvincing .
) Tillich as well .
"for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded ."
A second point requires more extended comment .
Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism .
yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population .
Some Catholic priests lecture there ; ;
English Catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope .
But how can one figure symbolize both ? ?
for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence .
yet each historical event remains unique .
Christ is both unique and universal .
"They were , in fact , children ."
Irenaeus does not claim pre-existence for the human soul ; ;
Historical existence is a created good .
Therefore Irenaeus describes man's creation as follows :
yet he did not stop being human as a result .
`` Eve was disobedient ; ;
That parallelism affects his picture of man's disobedience too ; ;
At the nadir of that circuit is death .
The wages of sin is death .
This applies to his picture of Adam .
Parker was never excommunicated .
"However , there is a crucial difference between the two histories ."
We stand more in awe of one another than most people .
Channing wrote this -- in a letter ! !
Reproach the Catholics for it ! !
You and I do the same thing .
We have no answer as to why we are not alarmed .
Are you longing for peace in your heart ? ?
Such a calm and assuring peace can be yours .
Perhaps you are not His child .
Perhaps you do not know if you belong to Him .
"`` I am resting today in His wonderful peace ,"
"I am kept from all danger by night and by day ,"
And His glory is flooding my soul '' .
"Satellites , sputniks , rockets , balloons ; ;"
Read your daily newspaper ! !
only a fool would think otherwise .
But we must not forget man's soul .
So it is spiritually .
Only He can satisfy the deepest longings .
`` The Lord is my light and my salvation ; ;
whom shall I fear ? ?
The Lord is the strength of my life ; ;
of whom shall I be afraid '' ? ?
He says : `` That would reduce neurotic ailments tremendously .
They are ' worry warts .
It must be getting more serious .
People are giving their doctors a hard time .
What is the real cause of them ? ?
What is there about us that makes us so anxious ? ?
"`` Sad '' was not the right word , of course ."
And that's worse than sad .
Maybe we are talking about them too much .
It could have the same effect on Communists .
whom shall I fear ? ?
The Lord is the strength of my life ; ;
of whom shall I be afraid '' ? ?
He didn't live in a world of perpetual peril like ours .
He didn't know anything about the problems we face today .
Our enemy is also threatening to devour us .
she was fatally injured .
"We are all involved in them , deeply involved ."
And nobody knows what comes next .
We live from crisis to crisis .
whom shall I fear ? ?
The Lord is the strength of my life ; ;
of whom shall I be afraid '' ? ?
"First , `` the Lord is my light '' ."
And there is light ! !
He lived in the dawn ; ;
he could only see the light coming over the horizon .
We live in the bright daylight of that great event ; ;
for us it is a fact in history .
So why worry about all the others ? ?
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? ?
This is the key to the conquest of fear .
The word is really `` stronghold '' .
The `` Lo Shu '' square as an expression of centrality
This whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on Chinese thinking .
Yin and Yang in the `` Lo Shu '' square
Neglect means spiritual paralysis or death .
It should not be postponed later than the next day .
A helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter .
This is not a social call .
It is definitely a `` spiritual guidance conference '' .
Each conference should be concluded naturally with prayer .
Some churches require more .
None should ask less .
The sessions should cover four major areas : A
-- The Christian Faith ; ;
Additional suggestions for membership preparation
The following have been found effective .
Extend the number of classes .
This gives greater opportunity for the learning process .
Have a `` Question Box '' .
Some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly .
Urge them to write out their questions for the box .
Use a textbook with assigned readings each week .
Select class members for reports on various phases of the study .
"Conduct examinations , using a true-false check sheet ."
Assign a series of catechism questions to be memorized .
What about transfers ? ?
People appreciate experiences that demand something of them .
Those who transfer their membership are no exception to the rule .
This is a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation .
"Psychologically the reception should be the climax , following the sermon ."
Provide a name card for each new member .
Outline plans for the entire service .
Sponsors may sit with them also .
Give each new member a certificate of membership .
Lead the congregation in a response of welcome .
Have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members as guests .
This is no spectator-type experience ; ;
everyone is to be a participant .
Something is wrong when these things happen .
"new members can become participating , growing members ."
It must be planned and carefully developed .
-- Welcome into the fellowship
-- Sincere Christian love and understanding
-- Inspiring and challenging worship experiences
-- Social and recreational activities
-- Opportunities for Christian service
-- Guidance in Christian social concerns .
The source of this paradox is not difficult to identify .
It lies in institutions .
A completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms ; ;
"to escape this fate , it must rule some things out ."
The suggestion is naive .
Man is at once a gregarious animal and a form-creating being .
"Both eventualities are possible logically , but practically they are impossible ."
Is there any way out of the predicament ? ?
The only way that I can see is through communication .
"Approached creatively , it is a high art ."
By personal factors I mean those rooted in personality structure .
Such needs may rise to pathological proportions .
But the problem extends elsewhere .
they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes .
I turn finally to several theological developments .
Comparable trends can be noted elsewhere .
Newbiggin's qualification on the Christian claim is of considerable significance .
"`` the worst , and least probable '' result ; ;"
Would such an act of refusal be useful ? ?
it is to stride along the steep slope downward .
There is some reality to this ; ;
`` Against the grain of creation ''
( This has not been the case everywhere .
There are sins of omission as well as commission ; ;
Our faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other .
We may feel pessimistic at the outlook .
It was only about the size of a baseball ; ;
Hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce .
We know that we have hydrogen in water ; ;
water is Af and the H stands for hydrogen ; ;
there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies .
"Salt water is still Af , the same hydrogen is there ."
Now let us see where this power comes from .
Pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas .
But we still have a long way to go .
then we have sextillion peas .
and then we have septillion .
A speck -- and space
"This is the atomic sun , the atomic nucleus ."
Someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing .
"At any rate , it shows us how immaterial we are ."
and therefore the atom was really just a little machine ; ;
"Harmony , melody , counterpoint symphonic structure are there ; ;"
the rest is obtained from harbor scallops .
At times we can say that it was the major factor .
At best only an approximation could be arrived at .
To generalize for the entire nation would be absurd .
Yet this cannot be proved .
"If guilty , the offender might be excluded from membership ."
The American dream was compounded of many strains .
Several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism .
Some disappeared with the attainment of their purpose .
The anti-slavery movement took many forms .
Weld was the son and grandson of New England Congregational ministers .
The majority then went to the infant Oberlin .
He shunned publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame .
But this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities .
This is the familiar system of `` cosmic government '' .
"In this system , no man is exempt from obligations ."
and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature .
Men believed they could control nature by obeying a moral code .
"In China , the magical system par excellence was Taoism ."
"in other words , they were actually an organization of magicians ."
Mahayana Buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts .
The self-realized Mahayana saint possessed superhuman powers and magic .
Zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience .
The need of the new birth
The new birth is necessary because all have sinned .
there is none who understands ; ;
All have gone astray together ; ;
That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; ;
and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
Evidences of the new birth
He who does not love abides in death .
That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; ;
and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
The nature of the new birth
the new birth is a new creation .
"behold , they are made new ! !"
For by grace you have been saved through faith ; ;
"not as the outcome of works , lest anyone may boast ."
The new birth is the implantation of a new life .
I came that they may have life .
He who has the Son has the life .
He who has not the Son has not the life .
The new birth is the impartation of the divine nature .
The new birth is Christ living in you by faith .
"Christ in you , your hope of glory ."
To have Christ dwelling through faith in your hearts .
The new birth is miraculous and mysterious .
So is everyone who is born of the Spirit .
The new birth is immediate and instantaneous .
The means of the new birth
"you may be baptized , confirmed , reverent and worshipful ; ;"
You cannot be saved ; ;
you cannot go to heaven unless you are born again .
He was then in man's hands .
Men spit on Him .
They called Him a devil .
You can do likewise though Christ is not bodily present .
You can ignore Him .
He is in your hands -- now .
The choice is up to you .
The latch is on your side of the door .
I am a magazine ; ;
my name is Guideposts ; ;
That purpose has never changed .
Some work with their hands .
"Fifteen years ago , there were no Guideposts at all ."
This month a million Guideposts will circulate all over the world .
Experts in the publishing field consider this astounding .
"To me , the explanation is very simple ."
"I am not doing anything , of myself ."
I am merely a channel for something .
What is this something ? ?
I cannot define it fully .
Sometimes such people sense that they are being used ; ;
The businessman was Raymond Thornburg .
The people who told the stories were sincere .
And the stories they told were true .
Len LeSourd is my executive editor today .
The help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere .
The crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me .
`` You're so preoccupied that you've let your faith grow dim .
What do you want -- a hundred thousand subscribers ? ?
And now a million January Guideposts are in circulation .
With our growth came expansion into new fields of service .
Today more than a thousand industries distribute me to their employees .
Bedridden people say I am easy to hold -- and read .
John Beach who guides circulation ; ;
Last summer John and Elizabeth Sherrill were in Alaska .
Van Varner recently returned from Russia .
"Around the table sit Protestant , Catholic , and Jew ."
Arthur Gordon comes once a month all the way from Georgia .
Today the cancer is gone .
That is the kind of people they are .
"Serious , yes , but also much laughter ."
"Sharp division of opinion , too , and strenuous debate ."
And there is also something intangible that hovers around the table .
A good word for it is fellowship .
A shorter word is .
I am a magazine ; ;
my name is Guideposts .
May He bless you all .
The hated dictator Batista had fled .
"And then Castro himself did come , bearded , smiling ; ;"
My grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials .
I was full of hope as Fidel Castro came into Havana .
"For Castro was bringing Cuba not freedom , but hatred ."
He seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance .
"Under another law , hundreds of farms were seized ."
Farm workers had their wages cut almost in half .
A suspicion was growing that Fidel Castro was a Communist .
his People's Courts ; ;
many came from Communist countries .
"What should I do about it , I asked myself ? ?"
I had watched Castro handling his enemies before the paredon .
What should I do ? ?
the thump and whir of our new presses .
`` You will lose the paper .
You may lose your life .
But do you have any choice '' ? ?
"After all , a guy's gotta have a little ego ! !"
There's Gaetan D'Amours who is our newest Mr. Canada ; ;
"Jean-Paul Senesac , whose story appeared here two issues ago ; ;"
"Jack Boissoneault , who was with us last month ; ;"
and a host of others .
"Yesiree , the professor knows his muscles ! !"
"Well , sir they did real great ! !"
Of course he did some exercising .
But he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body .
It was muscular but it wasn't symmetrical .
"`` A real ' nothing ' torso '' , says Henri ."
`` It never seemed to widen .
It just got longer and longer '' .
That's when he went to Professor Claude .
He has to ; ;
he just can't do anything about it at all ! !
This is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests ; ;
that steel-edged `` carved-out-of-solid rock '' looks of the great champions .
Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone .
the facet of muscular development that wins prizes .
It's a complete thigh contraction-extension exercise .
It increases flexibility of the legs .
Place a suitably-loaded barbell across them ; ;
That's the One-Leg Lunge in a nutshell .
"Oh , you'll wobble and weave quite a bit at first ."
He seemed puzzled by my question .
"`` I just love them '' , he said ."
Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care .
I asked him if he took seeds from his own plants .
Nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies .
Pansies don't have to be coddled ; ;
Then I cover the sowing with a board .
This keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds .
When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove the board .
"I like sawdust for this , or hay ."
I doubt if it is possible to overfeed them .
I spade lots of compost into their bed ; ;
"lacking that , decayed manure spread over the bed is fine ."
We put a light mulch over the seedlings ; ;
now we must use a heavy one .
When winter comes be ready with additional mulch .
That cold frame was my morale builder ; ;
"Go to a reputable grower , preferably a pansy specialist ."
in fact it is easier .
That is not true .
Would you like to grow exhibition pansies ? ?
The flowers will be huge .
"it is subtle and rather bland , nut-like ."
Naturally dormant and no spray danger
This happens on the grocer's shelf or in your kitchen .
There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed .
Nutritious and a cholesterol reducer
"Avocados , however , are very rich in nutrients ."
"The B vitamins are well represented , especially thiamin and riboflavin ."
The nation would be utterly devastated .
Is there any other way to do the job ? ?
Even mobile forces must be found and destroyed .
They are not susceptible to wholesale destruction by ballistic missile .
Nuclear rockets can destroy airfields with ease .
Aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once .
What targets have we successfully knocked out ? ?
What targets still remain to be hit ? ?
These crucial questions must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance .
Other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation .
"This is a serious-minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced ."
About the Pro Arte's contribution I am less happy .
"Some of Curzon's playing strikes me as finicky , however ."
"It is , moreover , a perfectly integrated ensemble effort ."
This recording surely belongs in everyone's collection .
Must records always sound like records ? ?
This difference is made up of many factors .
The sound may be good ; ;
The engineering as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness .
Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation .
yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer .
The timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance .
The engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result .
"Mrs. William H. Long , Jr. speaks"

Comes the suspicious question .
We've never been refused ! !
Is it that they don't care ? ?
The variety of craft on the country's waters today is overwhelming .
Boat prices vary according to the buyer's desires or needs .
"In this respect , boats can be compared with houses ."
There is no question as to just what is available .
You pay your money and you take your choice .
Now here is truly a marvel .
and to making the owning of a boat simpler .
It was much the same with pleasure boating at first .
"Come one , come all , the water's fine ! !"
must and should do .
"However , there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating ."
State numbering laws differ from each other in many ways .
The industry has been its own watch dog .
Industry interest in safety goes even farther .
These are not governmentally subsidized organizations .
"Instead of motels , for the boatman there are marinas ."
Boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel .
"Regardless of nomenclature , yachtels and boatels are marinas ."
Close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking bars .
Two or more dogs are mounted on each locking bar .
There are other basic rules .
By studying the track-signal diagrams you'll note several other details .
`` Home '' signals have two blades .
So much for the prototype .
Here's how it can be built .
These will be drilled and tapped later on .
Solder it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame .
Cap with a Af bar and tack-solder in place .
Remove all the loose spacing bars .
These are supporting members for the short locking bars .
These will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts .
The order of fitting is not too important .
All the bars are cut from Af brass .
See the drawings for the shape of the notch .
We used the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about
Such disks are very handy for cutting and shaping small parts .
File to a smooth finish .
Endeavor to get the notches as much alike as possible .
This tool can also be made with a lathe .
Hot rodding is a science .
This changes the formula to an `` equation '' .
Equations for rodding formulas are not complicated .
"They indicate simple division , multiplication , subtraction , and addition ."
The lower number is always divided into the upper number : Af
The symbol for multiplication is `` **b '' .
For example : Af .
Numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any order .
The result will be the same regardless of the order used .
The symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign .
This is nothing more than a dash .
It separates two or more numbers .
For example : Af .
Addition is indicated by the + symbol .
The symbol is used to separate two or more numbers .
For example : Af .
Numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed in any order .
The easiest way to do this is with a conversion chart .
Charts for this purpose are available from many sources .
Some formulas contain `` constants '' .
Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport .
"However , some formulas are used more than others ."
We'll take them in the general order of their popularity .
Displacement is sometimes referred to as `` swept volume '' .
Pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions of circles .
The formula is : Af .
The different steps will look like this : Af
Do not overfill the chamber .
The formula for this step is : Af .

Nor is she a wet boat .
We've been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry .
A lot of thought went into storage space construction .
Construction follows a thorough study of the drawings .
The frames are notched only for the keelson and the chines .
The jig is erected after the frames and transom are complete .
The frames are glued and screwed to this piece .
The stem is laminated from four pieces .
They're glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson .
All bottom battens are two inches wide .
The side ones are a half-inch narrower .
Four pieces are used .
Then trim the excess .
It may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings .
Then it is replaced and fastened .
The bottom planking is applied in the same manner .
"After planking , the bottom gets a layer of Fiberglas ."
Lay the cloth in place and trim it to size .
This protects the bottom in beaching .
They will also supply literature on application .
I set it on the Gator trailer .
These flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry .
The decking is quarter-inch mahogany marine plywood .
Most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring .

You can build this vacation cottage yourself .
"It is a big project , not to be taken lightly ."
"The idea behind our design is modular units , or panelization ."
Then you can do the finishing touches at your leisure .
in a remote section there might be no restrictions at all .
This can usually be found out at the nearest town hall .
These will be available at cost from our Plans Department .
Is there evidence of wash-outs on the property ; ;

Drill speeds are important if you want a good job .
Feed pressure is also of major importance .
There are numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes .
He says of it :
In appearance and construction it resembles the Pascataqua bridge .
he certainly deserves not a little credit for the invention '' .
The Essex Merrimack Bridge when first built was not covered .
Timothy Palmer had general supervision of the work .
It reads : `` chain bridges

"The horse and men were saved , but the oxen drowned ."
We have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard birds .
"But problems cling to pools , as any pool owner knows ."
We speak from varying viewpoints .
You are likely to be nearer the truth .
Probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts .
Our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled .
Had we taken a lien on a state park ? ?
We had merely been discovered by the pool sharks .
We were in business ! !
"So rules we made , in unabashed collusion ."
"Soignee pools , alas , do not just happen ."
You need more chlorine .
The walls feel slippery .
A pool is no place for a shut trap .
"When shed , they leave rust marks ."
Do not forget this possibility .
Two men can often do the installation in a day .
Is it worth-while ? ?
"The need for reupholstering , redecorating , repainting becomes more infrequent ."
It will improve your disposition .
"When you're less fatigued , things just naturally look brighter ."
That brings its per-year cost down mighty low .
The equipment won't take up valuable space either .
It can go in out-of-the-way waste space .
The cooling coil is located in the furnace's outlet .
They may be inaccessible later .
This is especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone .
"For cooling , chilled water is circulated instead of hot water ."
These systems are more expensive than year-'round forced air systems .
What size conditioner ? ?
Families with children usually don't want the house quite so cool .
Cooling requirements are best expressed in terms of Aj .
Coolers are also rated by tons .
You may find a conditioner rated by horsepower .
Better to have your equipment slightly undersized than too big .
Reducing humidity is often as important as cooling .
They're easier to shade there .
An attic space above insulation makes a house easier to cool .
Gas adds to the moisture load .
"Insulate , weatherstrip , double-glaze to the maximum ."
Avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom .
Most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning .
This is particularly true in site selection .
How much study is required ? ?
You need answers to four important questions .
What are the existing recreation features ? ?
How well can the site be developed ? ?
How useful will it be to the public ? ?
Is this site available ? ?
Quality is vitally important .
Most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas .
The quantity of water flow may be critical ; ;
Check the quality of the water .
How well can the site be developed ? ?
Many things need to be checked :
-- Topography is very important .
Figure the cost of providing water to the use areas .
-- The existing plant growth calls for thorough checking .
The extent and location of open areas is noted .
What was it to Prokofieff ? ?
a brilliant piece de resistance ? ?
All musical Paris was there .
"Some musicians were enthusiastic , some skeptical ."
"The answer is , `` Yes '' ! !"
in the spacious hunting grounds of `` Uncle Sam '' ; ;
"Meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing ."
But no : Prokofieff grew .
How right he was ; ;
His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable .
"His counterpoint is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick ."
"His fellow-countryman , Igor Stravinsky , certainly did not ."
What a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations ! !

But why gymnastics at all ? ?
And is the sport really important ? ?
"Taking first things first , let's understand the sport called gymnastics ."
Most Europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries .
The American is very lucky if he has three .
And what has dancing to do with all this ? ?
American audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons .
Dancers do have flexibility .
Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas .
For arm and shoulder strength a chinning bar is recommended .
Start on hands and feet .
Start on the knees in a large circle .
Push back up and repeat .
Do this exercise six times each class period .
Of course those who have developed more will find them easier .
The left will follow at once .
"The right will land first , followed by the left ."
Return to the standing position .
This will prevent flat falls and toe injuries .
Have the class lie supine with knees apart and bent .
Arch the back upwards to make a bridge .
"To further increase back flexibility , work on the back circle ."
Have the class lie prone .
Place the hands in front of the chest .
Keep the legs straight and the toes pointed .
"Straighten the arms slowly , this arches the back ."
One or two practice runs should be sufficient for solo .
the specimen is magnified by the microscope .
his wife taught the two boys to read and write Danish .
The mayor of the town taught them English and French .
they read every book that they could borrow in the village .
He openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing about science .
these were Oersted's main contacts in science .
This we might well witness '' .
His friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong .
His plan and intent were clearly charted .
He continued as a popular lecturer .

Feed is put in with an elevator .
No one material is best for all situations .
Selecting bunks by economic comparison is usually an individual problem .
This will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall .
There has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent years ; ;
there is every indication it will continue .
Greater demand for services .
There are two reasons for this .
"First , most products tend to become more complex ."
Wider discretionary choices for customers .
Geographic shift of customers .
Market concentration and distribution in fewer accounts .
more private label competition .
It has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program .
Higher costs of distribution generally .
The use of bulk handling is continuously growing .
Higher costs of advertising and promotion .
Increasing tempo of new product development .
Practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products on the horizon .
shortage of skilled salesmen .
There is a shortage of salesmen today .
Nor has the training been enough in relation to the need .
Shortage of sales management talent .
Complexity of complete marketing planning .
`` Hip-pocket '' tactics are going to be harder to apply .
They have to be .
Are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently in your company ? ?
"To begin with , what is an interior designer ? ?"
Furnishes complete cost estimates for clients approval .
This seems like a large order .
Yet even here many a problem is presented ; ;
"Unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem is the rule ."
Instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs of plants .
Thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience .
But to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable .
The necessity of that day has long disappeared .
There is plenty of opportunity for proper education today .
One technical question of school organization comes to mind here .
"The question , however , cannot be ignored for long ."
It is a sort of academic ring-around-a-rosy and you solve it .
Have you set specific objectives for your employee publication ? ?
Is it reaching these goals ? ?
Is it larger or fancier than you really need ? ?
Can your insurance company aid you in reducing administrative costs ? ?
"Holidays , time off , overtime"
Are you utilizing cafeteria space for company meetings or discussions ? ?
Do employees contribute their share of money to recreational facilities ? ?

Aim to balance your employee benefit package .
They're asking for union trouble .
Encourage them to exercise their benefits .
Some companies find a little imagination helpful .
Use deductable insurance wherever feasible .
Put a dollar-and-cents limit on benefits .
Don't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death .
Coffee breaks can be a real headache if not regulated .
Consider installing supplemental serving lines in production areas .
Choose carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans .
There are two sides of a coin for this decision .
Workers usually think more of a plan they contribute to .
"These include : leaves of absences , illnesses , and layoffs ."
This reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and startups .
This cuts the absentee rate .
Consider using vending machines rather than subsidized cafeterias .
You'll take the rap .
You may save valuable production minutes with a change .
This will cut the expense of vacation replacements .
Modern times have changed the world beyond recognition .
The early years of the twentieth century seem very far away .

Camping is big and getting bigger .
No one knows where it will stop .
You read various guesses on how many Americans are camping .
The number depends on who is talking at the moment .
But the campers still come .
They bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding .
They bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits .
Here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford .
Home is the place to find the comforts of home .
They're buying fun and adventure and family experiences .
"Today's campers want comforts , and they have them ."
Camp meals are no great problem .
"Neither are beds , thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags ."
the scientist who rebelled against the personnel and paper work ; ;
Some men have no talent for or interest in management ; ;
forcing them into management can only create trouble .
Labor fights to change its collar from blue to white .
Even the college professor in America has been affected .
"First : what title , what setup ? ?"
This is not a mutually exclusive plan ; ;
These positions carry such titles as :
"Consulting Engineer , Heat Transfer"
Senior staff engineer ? ?
There is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks ; ;
Several other examples : central and satellite
and many are engineers who have been advanced from the divisions .
These men are considered managers of engineers .
I suppose it is because we are just not big enough .
One way to formalize this is in the job structure .
"We have these positions , which compare directly : Af"
Top job : research scientist
The highest position is known as a ' research scientist .
This approach has not been entirely satisfactory .
The highest rated non-supervisory engineering title is ' research engineer .
Above this point there is no generally used parallel ladder .
`` We presently are involved in inaugurating a new development center .
But Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular .
How does Tri-State get its revenue from this plan ? ?
"However , that is not all he has to do ."
The Government housing agencies consider it feasible with one special stipulation .
The meter is mounted high on the basement wall .
But it's too early yet to go visit Oakwood Heights .
The big tanks were at the site but still sunning themselves .
Do it this way for the summer gargle :
"First , drain that old coolant down the storm sewer ."
"The word means it won't boil away easily , nothing else ."
Then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor .
Use the air hose for this job .
Check the temperature gage and be sure it is working .
Check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in during the summer .
Are you paying too much for your truck insurance ? ?
Have a talk with your insurance agent .
First go over the type of coverage you now have .
Look for these features which may mean you can save :
Avoid doubling up on the same item .
Does your policy have a lay-up clause ? ?
This applies to repair work of winter storage .
The figure five is important in insurance .
This means either cars or trucks .
And it's far from the end for plastics .
Why the trend to plastics ? ?
Plastic signs are economical .
Shipping cost is also reduced ; ;
Plastic signs work around the clock .
during daylight hours their brilliant colors command attention and interest .
What plastics to use ? ?
Its clarity and good optical properties are other important factors .
Trans-illuminated signs also show versatility in other directions .
Changeable letters fill many needs
Here are some of the newer items currently available :
Stainless steel screws were used to minimize corrosion stains .
Large injection-molded letters are also available for sign installations .
They are molded of a special weather-resistant formulation of Tenite butyrate .

"No , Bari was out of range ."
For Jenks knew that Bari's defenses were made of paper .
There were no R.A.F. fighter squadrons on Bari airfield .
The radar station with the best location was still not serviceable .
Telephone communication was bad .
`` It's up to you to protect yourselves .
They're all being used on offensive missions '' .
Vesole had been stunned .
Not fire until the bombs came down ! !
"Bari was asking for it , he thought ."
Richardson wondered when it would be unloaded .
Nine of them had gone down the gangplank already .
Richardson glanced to sea and started slightly .
It was a clear night and it was raining ! !
But he had mistaken it for bugs .
Musmanno was on deck .
He snatched at it savagely .
He turned the beam of his flashlight on it .
But how could -- ? ?
"Another , longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth ."
It was two feet long .

When they leave for vacations they miss the hot cereal .
Salads are served at least once a day .
Vegetables are served liberally .
Most come from the root cellar or from the freezer .
Home-made sauerkraut is served once a week .
Milk appears twice a day .
Lots of cheese made from June grass milk is served .
Finding sources for these high quality foods is a problem .
Sometimes the solution comes in unexpected ways .
Drinking with meals is also discouraged ; ;
pitchers of water merely appear on the tables .

Are you retiring now ? ?
How did I get to be sixty-five so fast ? ?
What do I do now '' ? ?
"Yes , retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly ."
Somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire .
We always thought we would die with our boots on .
Out of the blue comes talk of pension plans .
Compulsory retirement at sixty-five looms on our horizon .
"Still , it seems in the far future ."
"Suddenly , one day , up it pops ! !"
Sixty-five years and you've had it ! !

An important criterion of maturity is creativity .
The mature person is creative .
Privacy must be highly assured both in time and place .
The vagina is an organ capable of remarkable contraction and dilation .
The importance of loving tenderness is obvious .
Such talk is seriously in error .
"Differences were related to social , economic , and educational backgrounds ."
Everything else is closed away .
This is the ideal .
Instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual relationship .
But today there are signs that these roles are being reversed .
"To many experts , this trend was inevitable ."
They consider it simply a sign of our times .
"It can , in fact , wreck a marriage ."
"Caught at last , he was sentenced to prison ."
While he was in custody his wife divorced him .
Another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis .
Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage .
Naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative .
They aren't `` frigid '' and they aren't homosexual ; ;
they're just restrained in all of life .
They like to be dominated .
"But such cases were , in the past , unusual ."
When was the turning point ? ?
When did women begin to assert themselves sexually ? ?
They began to describe in detail the woman's capacity for response .
Often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction '' .
Then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list .
"He must begin , paradoxically , by becoming more selfish ."
"She gave herself a title , Lady Diana Harrington ."
She never hid the fact that she liked to play .
`` This girl is the Golden Girl of cafe society .
She was in Egypt during the revolution and had passport difficulty .

She developed another quaint habit .
More often than not he would bow to the inevitable .
One who needed no such threats was a French financier .
One of the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was for travel .
She could do no wrong at the tables that time .
No one ever learned what happened to the Greek .
Discreet Italian police described it in a manner typically continental .
`` They were wearing nothing but their scratches .
They were asked to leave the hotel .
No charges were filed '' .
"The girls , after dressing , were indignant ."
"`` You can't do this to us '' , Diane screamed ."
`` We are Americans '' .
`` It was a strange relationship .
Pulley Bey spoke no English .
Diane spoke no Italian or French .
It seemed as though she were always auditioning .
With the end of the trial Diane disappeared from New York .
"Last May , they said , she admitted being a prostitute ."
The next time the police saw her she was dead .
Pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the walls .
An autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in Diane's body .

An isolated case of quackery ? ?
You will come up with a frightening total .
She suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized .
"Yes , Tom caught it in time to stay alive ."

Mr. H. is dead today because he followed this advice .
"Moreover , her husband and child contracted T.B. from her ."
By no means are these isolated cases .
Have no doubt about it .
That's where device quackery can lead .
Who are the victims of the device quacks ? ?
Authorities say that oldsters are a prime target .
They are often ignorant as well as underprivileged .
Mr. and Mrs. Stewart were puzzled and concerned .
Richard Stewart is no special case .
How can they tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment ? ?
Why and when should tooth-straightening be undertaken ? ?
What is it likely to cost ? ?
"These two basic malformations have , of course , many variations ."
A noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower jaw .
"Crooked , overlapping , twisted , or widely spaced teeth ."
Front teeth not meeting when the back teeth close .
Upper teeth completely covering the lowers when the back teeth close .
every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by their malformed teeth .
The when and how of straightening
they are not anchored directly to the bone .
Last comes the retention stage .
Susie's teeth have now been guided into a desirable new position .
How long will this take ? ?
Aligning all the teeth may take a year or more .
What is the cost ? ?
growth studies have been carried on consistently by orthodontists .
This knowledge both modifies and dictates diagnosis and treatment .
Now a dentist can recommend extraction immediately .
Superior new material for orthodontic work is another result of research .
"He can correct decay , thus preventing early loss of teeth ."
There are a few prognoses of coming events .
But it is not really only a conversation .
For this was to be a `` proxy sitting '' .
Sometimes in these experiments `` appointment sittings '' are used .
"`` He had four children , two sets of twins ."
that fewer women are named Miranda than Elizabeth ; ;
"Specific dates would be important , as would double names ."
That is one thing the experiments are designed to find out .
Perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all .
Nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret her imagery .
During one reading an image appeared of a prisoner in irons .
But this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail ; ;
"Livestock must be tended every day , routinely ."
The worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily .
such a move may mean a loss of capital .
Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of life .
Production may fall far below expectations .
This may be true whether the farm is owned or rented .
"If the farm is rented , the rent must be paid ."
A farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children .
It gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air .
The children can do chores adapted to their age and ability .
Some persons consider the work on a farm recreational .
"Land , labor , and equipment needed"
This is a highly speculative venture .
"As a rule , part-time farmers hire little help ."
Obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road .
If you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby .
Look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes .
Few rural areas are protected by zoning .
Facilities in the area .
You cannot get along without an adequate supply of pure water .
A pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden .
The value of the farm to you will depend on --
Its worth as a place to live .
The value of the products you can raise on it .
The possibilities of selling the property later on for suburban subdivision .
"Next , estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm ."
Estimate the value of the produce at normal prices .
The total is the probably gross income from farming .
But what could the Eichmann Trial initiate ? ?
Of what new course could it mark the beginning ? ?
These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution's case .
"This , in fact , it turned out to be ."
`` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? ?
The Trial should have asked the nations .
Only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin .
"Three agreed , but four declined and were suspended ."
All too often our language is unduly harsh .
Why is it so different in regard to birth control ? ?
The so-called `` noble experiment '' came to an inglorious end .
This was generally reflected in the civil laws of Christian countries .
Many other Protestant denominations preceded the Anglicans in such action .
"The captain was gone , and the mate was gone ."
What disaster struck the Discovery during those seventeen months ? ?
What happened to the fourteen missing men ? ?
"All told , they offered a highly confused picture ."
"First , they wanted to clarify a tantalizing , bizarre enigma ."
The name : Henry Hudson .
The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship .
The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear .
"( Later , it was to be called Hudson Strait ."
"Ahead were perilous , ice-filled waters ."
And he refused to be anything else .
"He was a Londoner , married , with three sons ."
The subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome .
Floating ice bore down from the north and west .
Fog hung over the route constantly .
Turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet .
The trouble was at least partly Juet's doing .
The statement was effective .
The meeting broke up .
Hudson was free to sail on .
This must have been Hudson's blackest discovery .
"Feverishly , he tried to brush away this intuition ."
"Once more , Juet's complaints were the loudest ."
Hudson's reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty .
Juet demanded that Hudson prove his charges in an open trial .
"Juet had made plentiful enemies , several men stepped forward ."
Cook Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted bloodshed on the ship .
Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward .
Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay .
"The new mate was Robert Bylot , talented but inexperienced ."
The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor .
Some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive .
Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression .
"She is a regular stub and twister , double geered ."
Humor found many modes of expression .
One of the most common of camp maladies was diarrhoea .
but a much more common designation was `` the sh-ts '' .
I eat too much eggs and poark .
Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing about their heads .
But fathers often addressed communications to their small children ; ;
Occasionally they would write to the slaves .
Unmarried soldiers carried on correspondence with sweethearts at home .
But these comments are hardly printable .
I told them some sweet lies and they believed it all .
Some of the letters were pungently expressive .
I will shute him as shore as I sea him '' .
Went out a skouting yesterday .
We got to one house where there were five secessionists .
He is not worth shucks .
"In America , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose ."
Abraham Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national Constitution .
Robert E. Lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy .
The problems confuse even the experts .
"For that matter , the experts themselves are a mixed breed ."
They have widely varying backgrounds and aims .
They have little `` esprit de corps '' .
The collector enjoys the contact with rural life ; ;
The analyst is apt to be too honest to fit in .
Is the writer propagandistic ? ?
The coalition was to prove inadvisable .
"He killed accurately , freely , and dispassionately ."
Like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol .
He had no apparent comprehension of morality ; ;
two years later he served another three months for assault .
But by now O'Banion's political pull was beginning to be effective .
"As promptly as Torrio , O'Banion jumped into bootlegging ."
But whose requirements ? ?
"A. O'Banion , in his pistol pocket '' ."
"However , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever ."
The result was a landslide for the Republican candidates .
he was neither prosecuted nor even arrested .
O'Banion's reaction was : `` Three hundred dollars ! !
To them bums ? ?
He says he don't want no trouble '' .
But he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate .
O'Banion's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal .
The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves .
"Tsunami are rare , however , in the Atlantic Ocean ; ;"
they are far more common in the Pacific .
A tsunami is not a single wave but a series .
The waves may keep coming for many hours .
He was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves .
The third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest .
Scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon .
Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands .
Ordinary water tides are disregarded .
The warning system immediately went into action .
The key to the world of geology is change ; ;
nothing remains the same .
Superstition has often blended with fact to color reports .
Two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts .
The restless earth and its interior
A sharp tremor was followed by a jerky roll .
The cry `` Garryowen '' ! !
Chandler understood this and expected the worst .
Chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice .
"Instead Sergeant Early was quiet , sharp and confident ."
He could lead a patrol and he knew his paper work .
He was filled with the spirit of the Fighting Seventh .
That saved Mel Chandler .
The final proof was a small incident .
And so Mel Chandler got the spirit of Garryowen .
"Then it came , against Troop Aj ."
They came in waves .
Captain Chandler saw that it was building up strength .
Then Mel Chandler started up the hill .
The first thing he knew the words `` Garryowen '' ! !
Burst from his throat .
"Enemy reinforcements came pouring down , seeking a soft spot ."
Marvin Goulding saw what was happening .
He turned to his platoon .
"`` Okay , men '' , he said ."
`` Follow me '' .
"On his lips , his men following ."
They charged into the enemy like wild men .
Today he is a major -- in the Regular Army .
Many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him .
He was a member of The Fighting Seventh .
Peace is a worthy objective ; ;
Justice is a worthy objective ; ;
Prosperity is a worthy objective ; ;
One was demonstrably false ; ;
"the other , for the most part , true ."
Success may mean merely the displacement of Western influence .
And this may be as far as the process will go .
To recite the particulars of recent Soviet successes is hardly reassuring .
Today Northern Vietnam is overtly Communist ; ;
Laos is teetering between Communism and pro-Communist neutralism ; ;
"Cambodia is , for all practical purposes , neutralist ."
in almost every particular follow the Kremlin's foreign policy line .
A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve .
Today it is up for grabs .
What have we to show by way of counter-successes ? ?
we moved decisively to effect an Anti-Communist coup d'etat .
`` Sounds exactly like last time '' .
Then he was sick .
Then the lights went out .
Where was my flashlight ? ?
Where should I go ? ?
To my room ? ?
Hotel attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby .
A woman with a small boy slipped in between them .
"`` Please '' , she said , `` please '' ."
She held out her hand to show that she had money .
The American newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office .
But what was the story ? ?
Had the Communist-led Pathet Lao finally come this far ? ?
Or was it another revolt inside Vientiane ? ?
"`` Let's play hero '' , I said ."
`` Let's go to the roof and see '' .
There had been an eclipse of the moon .
How quaint it all seemed the next day .
Along the main thoroughfares hardly a house had not been peppered .
Nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are .
They spread over an area no larger than Oregon ; ;
Life must be kept in harmony
What matters here is family loyalty ; ;
and to live in harmony with nature '' .
Harmony in Laos ? ?
"`` Precisely '' , said Mr. Frans ."
The slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering Mekong River .
Even life in harmony with death .
In the end we ran into Communist artillery fire .
"Boun My , our interpreter ; ;"
He had attended three universities in the United States .
"Alas , so it almost proved for us , too ."
To go outside the few cities required permits .
And getting them seemed a life's work .
From his shoulder bag peeked the seven-inch barrel of a Luger .
It was a spleen-crushing day .
"Then off again , rushing to keep up ."
"`` What you see are self-help projects '' , John said ."
Ask Mr. Keo '' .
"`` Where there was no road , they lived without one ."
That's a big step toward a modern state .
You might say we are in the nation-building business '' .
In the villages people lined up to give us flowers .
"Then came coconuts , eggs , and rice wine ."
Then we were off again .
We did it for three days .
But our stumping tour of the south wasn't all misery .
Then we hung overboard in the water .
Strings keep souls in place
This is the most endearing of Lao ceremonies .
Next he addressed himself to our souls .
It had a festering hole as big as a silver dollar .
We could see maggots moving .
Jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings .
`` It means that you have to get ahead '' .
"`` I like the tradition '' , a girl said ."
`` I like to follow the holidays when they come along .
But you don't have to worship in the traditional way .
You can communicate in your own way .
it's to be a good person '' .
This accords with the study by Maier and Spinrad .
Most of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds .
She is even prone to regard the college girl as immature .
The lower-middle class college student
"There is , to begin , an important sex difference ."
There are two reasons for this .
Brooklyn College students have an ambivalent attitude toward their school .
`` You don't have to watch what you say .
"It's so much trouble , I don't usually bother '' ."
"For girls , the overprotection is far more pervasive ."
The breaking away from the prison house of Brooklyn is gradual .
The great world beyond beckons .
"Among the boys , there is very little bravado about drinking ."
Brooklyn College is distinctive for not having an official drinking place .
This should be used frequently ( but shaken before using ) .
This could also be used for any other skin irritation .
The sufferer drinks tansy tea .
Bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of raw beefsteak .
) Salted butter was another cure for bruises .
Later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns .
"To stop bleeding , cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds ."
this would stop the flow and also prevent infection .
there is scarcely a scar showing .
Tobacco was common first aid .
His brother ran a mile to get the father ; ;
Tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound .
Insect bites were cured in many ways .
Many an old-timer swore by the saliva method ; ;
This was used also for bruises .
not long ago `` Denver Mud '' was most popular .
Ant bites were eased by applying liquid bluing .
mud was sometimes used as well as soap .
Bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days ; ;
Kerosene was very effective in ridding pioneer homes of the pests .
At times pioneer children got lice in their hair .
Now one hears that heat and hot water are used instead .
Chilblains were also treated with tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves .
Boils have always been a source of much trouble .
This was also used for sores .
There were many cures for warts .
I know this worked .
"As the onion decayed , so did the wart ."
Sore muscles were relieved by an arnica rub ; ;
"This does give relief , as I can testify ."
"It may , on occasion , be anything but that ."
Wine waiters are something else again ; ;
Now the drinking of wine ( and happily so ! !
"otherwise , the cork dries and air enters to spoil it ."
"if it smells of cork , one has grounds for suspicion ."
Prolonged vibration is also undesirable ; ;
"Light , especially daylight , is always bad for wine ."
It may be a bit cold when poured ; ;
But white wines never ! !
"Thus , Sauternes or Barsacs should be very cold ; ;"
a Pouilly-Fuisse or a Chablis somewhat less cold .
Decanting old wine aerates it fully ; ;
and Alsatians may be .
Giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation .
An excellent crop was expected that year .
"Lacking specific instructions , he agreed to William's condition ."
Palfrey petitioned the state legislature to waive the requirement .
During his journey Palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists .
He had a short private talk with each adult slave .
the slaves were to remain as wage laborers for his account .
Not all of Palfrey's slaves were aboard the Bashaw .
Two of these were included in Palfrey's lot .
Many of the new appointees are art collectors .
McNamara is the scholar-businessman .
"his wife , Marion , is a portrait painter ."
The list goes on .
Two men show promise of playing prominent roles :
"Nonetheless , they found common interests ."
But his credentials are impeccable .
A more official representative is the Secretary of the Interior .
He is not likely to win this battle easily .
eleven others were introduced .
Mrs. Kennedy shows a determination to change all this .
She traced it to a storage room .
A curator has been appointed .
Only a few days after moving into the White House .
Kennedy made a midnight inspection of the Square .
The situation involved some political perils .
"Logically , it should be moved downtown ."
There were aesthetic problems as well as political .
"Surrounded by ancient elms , the campus is spacious and beautiful ."
The buildings are mostly Georgian .
But there has always been an outdoor air to Dartmouth .
No one here pokes fun at manly virtues .
It even affects the faculty .
So he kissed her .
No Dartmouth man was surprised .
Dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal sang-froid .
"For example , groups regularly canoe down the Connecticut River ."
And these hardy travelers are not unappreciated today .
Dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic recreation is skiing .
"Forty miles farther north is Mount Moosilauke , Dartmouth's own mountain ."
and also of English Youth and any others '' .
About two-thirds of the boys now come from public schools .
It is still a college only and not a university ; ;
It has come on with a rush in more significant areas .
The person who left the buggy there has never been identified .
Uncle John Vinnicum Morse was the immediate popular suspect .
He said he would have convicted `` somebody '' .
These officers found no incriminating information .
Morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed .
Fall River is not a fashionable town .
The dinner hour there was twelve noon .
Police did make an attempt to check on Morse's alibi .
We do know that Morse left the house before nine o'clock .
Bridget testified she saw him leave through the side door .
Morse said Borden let him out and locked the screen door .
He met nobody he knew on this walk .
Bridget's testimony was in direct contradiction .
This was long after Morse had left the house .
It was unlocked all the time she was washing windows .
The motive may have been the mysterious quarrel ; ;
there was no financial gain for Morse in the murders .
Neither had any interest in the deaths ; ;
Both he and Bridget were exonerated by Lizzie herself '' .
He felt nothing further need be said about the servant girl .
"Lizzie , actually , never named any suspect ."
They have not been friendly for years '' .
"Asked who this was , she named Harrington ."
Her statement certainly was true ; ;
He said he had not heard of anybody else .
`` How about Bridget Sullivan '' ? ?
There are also other factors that require closer examination .
"Bridget was born in Ireland , one of fourteen children ."
The daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical subjects .
But even so Lucy could not give up her intellectual pursuits .
'' And that she proceeded to do .
Mathematics came next '' .
Her study of history was persistently pursued .
more chapters of Guizot ; ;
She played chess with him by postcard .
There was another family interest also .
"Winslow had musical talents , as had his father before him ."
Lucy was a lively part of the household .
"Moreover , she had physical as well as mental vigor ."
Here was a cause she believed in .
of her `` great power of discernment '' ; ;
her great love of flowers and plants and birds ; ;
and her close knowledge of individual students .
Both had eager and inquiring minds ; ;
"Both loved the out-of-doors , including mountain climbing and horseback riding ."
Yet they thrived on it .
and that the year's work had gone forward smoothly .
She urged the importance of more thorough preparation for admission .
Rockefeller and Packard Halls had been renovated ; ;
and ground had been broken for the superintendent's home .
Now the school was indeed bereft .
She remained in Atlanta through June and July ; ;
she died on August sixth .
But she decided to stay at Spelman .
Soon the office work claimed all her time .
The books of the school hold a memorial to her ; ;
and so do the hearts of students and of teachers .
He receives remuneration for his work .
Rather we see here another vicious circle .
How can the vicious circle be broken ? ?
Two stories will illustrate what I have in mind .
"`` He'll have no difficulty '' , I was told ."
`` He has very good connections '' .
The residue from soybean processing goes mainly into animal feeds .
Peanuts are the world's second most important legume .
They are used mainly for their oil .
The rest is used for human food and industrial products .
Seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively minor position .

Flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters still are used by some persons .
"Sesame sticks , a snack dip , originated in the Southwest ."
Beverages are made from seeds the world over .
Cereal grains have been used for centuries to prepare fermented beverages .
The Japanese sake is wine fermented from rice grain .
Arrack is distilled from fermented rice in India .
"Brewers today use corn , rice , and malted barley ."
Hay and pasture are the other chief sources of livestock feed .
That became their `` home range '' .
You couldn't stop 'em ; ;
The cowboy called this breed of cattle `` magpies '' .
Cows givin' no milk were knowed as `` strippers '' .
The term soon became used and applied to all stolen animals .
A cow rose from the ground rear end first .
Shippin' cattle by train was called a `` stock run '' .
A general classification given grass-fed cattle was `` grassers '' .
Colors of cattle came in for their special names .
Such an animal was said to be `` mealynosed '' .
"This word was from the Spanish , meanin' `` polecat '' ."
Such an animal has frequently been the downfall of the rustler .
It was John who found the lion tracks .
Kearton focussed his field glasses .
"As they watched , Jones rode straight for the Reef ."
The dogs were working a trail -- lion ? ?
"`` Not yet '' , cautioned Ulyate ."
"A motley pack , chosen for effectiveness , not beauty ."
`` Light it '' ! !
Two quick shots sounded .
Then there was a chorus of wild barking and baying .
Then the heavy roar of a lion .
Nice country to meet a lion in face to face .
She's just the other side of that bush '' ! !
"Why she doesn't charge him , I don't know ."
And he hasn't even got a knife on him .
He couldn't get away from her in this kind of ground .
"Careful , don't disturb her '' ."
He threw the lasso .
But now she sank lower to the rock .
Her roar changed to a growl .
Her tail no longer lashed .
She was rested and could mount a charge .
`` We've got to get her out of there '' ! !
"Jones yelled , `` or she'll kill 'em all ."
Bring me the firecrackers '' .
"`` Ain't she a beauty , though '' ? ?"
Called out Means as she ran .
The dogs were tired .
The men were tired too .
It was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again .
And the sun was beginning to go down .
If dark came they would lose her .
"Loveless , too , objected ."
"`` It won't work , Colonel '' ."
`` Just the same we'll try it '' .
She had chosen the spot well .
"`` Careful , now '' , Jones warned ."
Means tried her first .
Means spit and edged on .
"Again she snarled , and again he edged ."
The pony was sidewise to her .
"With a whirling jump , it could get into gear ."
Means spun and spurred .
For thirty yards she gained rapidly .
Means held steady one jump ahead of her .
Then gradually he began to pull away .
Photos showed later that she'd been about six feet from Means .
Of course the factor of head start made all the difference .
How much head start ? ?
No one knew exactly .
That was the whole question .
"Enough , was the answer ."
Tossing his rope and shouting he attracted her attention .
From behind her Means shot forward at a run .
But Means kept on .
It is here that the local and ecumenical must meet .
This way of describing the matter is unfortunate .
It implies two misconceptions .
It is hardly possible to emphasize this too much .
The local and the ecumenical are one .
Neither is adequate if it stands alone .
Our difficulty arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other .
And this is what all too often happens .
It is eminently successful according to all conventional standards .
It is growing in numbers .
Its people are agreeable friends .
It has a beautiful edifice .
It provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled .

Narrative time and film time
So is the time of the novel .
The time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely .
This is the rate of projection ; ;
it is also the rate of photographing .
The Great Train Robbery is a one-reel film .

We passed his house and school on the way .
A better world may yet come out of Hiroshima .
Here the women learn to keep house as maids ; ;
they become skilled in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests .
Occasionally they return for additional training .
These principles we have now set forth .
Both the conditions and the complicity are documented in considerable detail .
I write about Northern liberals from considerable personal experience .
The strong feeling is certainly there ; ;
There are of course many Souths ; ;
Nobody knows how many Southerners there are in this category .
I never heard of a poll being taken on the question .
No doubt such a thing would be considered unpatriotic .
All Southerners agree that slavery had to go ; ;
"And this , in effect , means most of modern America ."
It is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise .
There seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it .
"Whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites ."
A concept of responsibility is in process of articulation and establishment .
The `` positive state '' came into existence .
But it is more than that .
it becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis .
The former receives its legitimacy from the latter .
High-level abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision .
Is there a different reality behind the facade ? ?
Does the surface hide a quite different picture ? ?
The short answer to those questions is `` yes '' .
Both concepts are undergoing alteration ; ;
Can thermonuclear war be set off by accident ? ?
Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety ? ?
Will the danger increase or decrease ? ?
"There is unceasing pressure , but its sources are immediate ."
`` Readiness exercises '' are almost continuous .
Each could be the real thing .
They know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details .
These men are not callous .
It is their job to think about the unthinkable .
Alternate locations exist for all key command centers .
Additional codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications .
But what if somebody decides to break it ? ?
He makes the momentous decision .
Nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers .
All can be connected with the gold circuit from their homes .
Vital questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda .
"For these centers , too , are on the gold circuit ."
NATO headquarters in Europe ; ;
"and SAC , which controls long-range bombers and Atlas missiles ."
"In a word , plenty ."
His eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown .
"His movements and speech are precise , clear and quick ."
No question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate .
In front of him is a gold phone .
General Power would participate in the decision making .
"Wisman , below , would listen in and act ."
"But Wisman , too , does not know the go code ."
He must take it from `` the red box '' .
But even the contents of Wisman's box cannot start a war .
"They are mere fragments , just one portion of preprepared messages ."
The answer is a cryptographic secret .
All three must compare notes and agree to `` go '' .
"Suddenly , however , their posture changed and the game ended ."
Their heads were in the air sniffing .
They all swung at the same instant in the same direction .
"They saw it before I did , even with my binoculars ."
A white man would not have seen it .
The aborigines fastened upon it with a concentration beyond pathos .
At once the whole band set off at a lope .
They were chasing a rain cloud .
"The games were over , this was life ."
Sometimes it was to skirt a gulley .
Their gait is impossible to convey in words .
It is a barely controlled skimming of the ground .
They ran for three hours .
Then the wind died and the rain squall held steady .
They were studying the ground .
He had found a depression with rain water in it .
The other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle .
In an instant he had sucked it dry .
The aborigine lives on the cruelest land I have ever seen .
Which does not mean that it is ugly .
"Part of it is , of course ."
Such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality .
Nothing appalling or horrible rushed upon these men .
Only there happened -- nothing .
"It might have rained , any time ; ;"
only -- it did not .
only -- there was not .
No one came '' .
The white men died .
And countless others like them have died .
The aborigine is not deceived ; ;
he knows that the land is hard and pitiless .
There is no room for error or waste .
The family at the boulder
seeing an aborigine today is a difficult thing .
At once he started to glance toward the instrument panel .
The rancher was navigating his way across the flatland .
`` Do you always navigate like this '' ? ?
"`` Damned right '' , he said ."
`` Once I get out on the flat I do .
The landscape kept repeating itself .
Finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines .
"There was also a dog , a dingo dog ."
It struck me as a very bright and very malnourished dog .
No one patted the dog .
It was not a pet .
It was a worker .
"`` The buggers love shade '' , the rancher said ."
"They'll move around that rock all day , following the shade ."
The man was leaning against the rock .
He gazed away from us as we approached .
He was over six feet tall and very thin .
His legs were narrow and very long .
He had long black hair and a wispy beard .
I turned to look at the lubra .
"like the man , she was entirely naked ."
"There was also a boomerang , elaborately carved ."
The smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant .
But that is a cliche and a dishonest one .
"`` That smell is something , eh , mate '' ? ?"
"`` Here , Idje , you fella like tabac '' ? ?"
Idje still stared over our shoulders at the horizon .
The Afghans invaded ; ;
the Safavids fell from power ; ;
the capital went elsewhere ; ;
they are the places where Persians live .
"The air , he said , was just right ; ;"
a cigarette would taste particularly good .
I really didn't know what he meant .
"It was a nice day , granted ."
But he knew ; ;
It is a splendid structure .
"Below , twenty vaults tunnel through the understructure of the bridge ."
It is a great spectacle .
a Bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket ; ;
the old Kajar princes arriving in their ancient limousines ; ;
"It contains , in fact , their whole outlook on life ."
Poetry for a Persian is nothing less than truth and beauty .
The singer simply matches the poem to a mode ; ;
Did he come from a musical family ? ?
When he was eight he began violin lessons .
His professional career began when he was twenty ; ;
"Yes , the Maestro assented ."
Had he always wished to be a conductor ? ?
Where in Europe was he going now ? ?
My Pittsburghers have become real addicts to Mahler and Bruckner '' .
Bruckner's Eighth he refers to as `` my travel symphony '' .
And how did he feel about modern art ? ?
"But after all , you never learned anything else '' ! !"
What did he do for relaxation ? ?
He cited Heine and Stendhal as favorites in literature .
"I was chairman , the only not youthful participant ."
`` It is easy for you to talk '' ; ;
We would like to do that too '' .
One girl expressed what was obviously in their minds .
`` Would you advise us to act the same way ? ?
You might have failed .
I think it is rather foolhardy to trust to luck '' .
What they wished for most was security ; ;
Our successors will have an easier task '' .
The Seven Founders were completely dedicated to the public service .
He served as Commander in Chief during the Revolution without compensation .
The Frenchman was astonished .
"`` Think continentally '' , Hamilton counseled the young nation ."
Tobacco Road is dead .
Long live Tobacco Road .
such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification .
"the list is , obviously , endless ."
But these sources have not been tapped .
such are simply not within his bounded province .
Where are the writers to treat these changes ? ?
This represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem .
only historical evolution will determine which ) : an abrupt change .
A new order is thrusting itself into being .
It bewilders and befuddles him .
There are almost no fictional treatments of the industrialized south '' .
"He treats it with a mythological , universal application ."
"He disdains external restrictions -- conventional syntax , traditional metre ."
"He is still concerned , however , with a personal event ."
The concept remains subjective .
Others look to more objective devices of order .
The system works as an impersonal mechanism .
"Again , the composer must select his own materials ."
Some let dances take their form from the experience of creation .
Even the least alteration will change the quality .
This became a dance called Prelude To Flight .
Alwin Nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal emotion .
But the metamorphosis must come first .
But I would never have thought of it myself '' .
At one side of the stage a dancer jumps excitedly ; ;
A man and a girl happen to meet ; ;
"they look straight at the audience , not at each other ."
Events occur without apparent reason .
He may toss coins ; ;
he may take slips of paper from a grab bag .
Each performance may be different .
Mr. Cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method ; ;
he adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can .
Then the choreographer must arbitrate .
We began by declaring that all men are created equal .
"These are not , however , differences in federal structure ."
The truth on each side won in the civil war
There was a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another .
One wonders about its applicability to people .
"The answer is , of course , yes ."
We have ample light when the sun sets ; ;
the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons ; ;
the range of our voice ignores distance .
At what stage are social sciences then ? ?
Perhaps things were even worse then .
It is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears of man .
The bombs are as harmless as an automobile in a garage .
They include both individual fears and collective ones .
There is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision .
A meteor could fall on San Francisco .
Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought .
Yet we no longer feel uneasy .
What elements of our behavior are decisive ? ?
With the group of boys it is different .
"Small wonder , then , that we fear ."
"In some areas , the progress is slower than in others ."
"In child care , the opposite extreme prevails ; ;"
"Nothing like Godot , he arrived before the hour ."
American newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic .
They find deep pessimism in them .
Nevertheless I was curious .
Beckett's appearance is rough-hewn Irish .
"The features of his face are distinct , but not fine ."
One might say it combines the man ; ;
own pride and humility .
The mouth frequently breaks into a disarming smile .
His tweed suit was a baggy gray and green .
He wore a brown knit sports shirt with no tie .
I reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation .
`` The confusion is not my invention .
It is not a mess you can make sense of '' .
`` What is more true than anything else ? ?
"To swim is true , and to sink is true ."
One is not more true than the other .
I am not a philosopher .
"Until recently , art has withstood the pressure of chaotic things ."
It has held them at bay .
It realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form .
It is there and it must be allowed in '' .
And why not ? ?
Beckett's own work is an example .
The form and the chaos remain separate .
The latter is not reduced to the former .
Isn't all art ambiguous ? ?
This does not allow the mystery to invade us .
"With classical art , all is settled ."
But it is different at Chartres .
Didi and Gogo hover on the edge of suicide ; ;
Is this life-death question a part of the chaos ? ?
"If there were only darkness , all would be clear ."
How can we make sense of this division ? ?
"In classical drama , such problems do not arise ."
"As she goes , she herself will be illuminated ."
That is the play .
The key word in my plays is ' perhaps ' '' .
"`` Well , really there is none at all ."
I have no religious feeling .
Once I had a religious emotion .
It was at my first Communion .
My mother was deeply religious .
So was my brother .
My father had none .
"Irish Catholicism is not attractive , but it is deeper ."
"`` Yes , for they deal with distress ."
Some people object to this in my writing .
As if it were perverse to do so ! !
Then he thought me more perverse than ever .
One does not have to look for distress .
He says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern .
`` Perhaps '' stands in place of commitment .
but there is also compassion .
Yet it is not only Europe the play refers to .
"`` All is not sex '' , declared Lawrence ."
Man is not confined to one outlet for his vital energy .
But for the beat generation all is sex .
That is reserved for the squares .
What they are after is the beatific vision .
"Jazz , like sex , is a mystique ."
They are non-conformists on principle .
There is nothing holy in wedlock .
"In the realm of physical sensations , sex reigns supreme ."
Who are the creative representatives of this movement ? ?
They are full of contempt for the institution of matrimony .
Everything in the final analysis reduced itself to sexual symbolism .
Part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana .
For drugs are in themselves no royal road to creativity .
There were fences in the old days when we were children .
Side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses ; ;
What one actually remembers is its greenness .
That was one epoch : the apple-tree epoch .
Another had ended before it began .
Time is a queer thing and memory a queerer ; ;
Time in the sum is nothing .
That world was in scale with my own smallness .
It was mother who planted the verbenas .
"Flowers , stones , and small creatures , living and dead ."
"No one seemed to hear him , no one heeded ."
"The horse plodded on , and he repeated his call ."
"After his passage , the street was empty again ."
The sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down ; ;
"they were like this fifty-odd years ago , and yesterday ."
The street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center ; ;
It had a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since .
a modulation described as `` almost a stroke of genius '' .
"he collapses , and dies ."
the epiphany of that quivering flesh ; ;
Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann's heroes .
and the motion toward it brings disaster .
There is no more `` plot '' than that ; ;
"that is to say , to the churchyard '' ."
And the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction .
"But that is too simple , and won't hold up ."
"This man's isolation is not merely momentary , it is permanent ."
His rage assumes a religious form ; ;
This passion brings on a fit which proves fatal .
The ambulance is drawn by two `` charming '' little horses .
"Piepsam is not , certainly , religious in any conventional sense ."
the two may in fact be identical .
"Piepsam is grotesque , a disturbing parody ; ;"
his end is ridiculous and trivial .
he is simply thrown out of the shop by the porter .
Their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason .
The mimetic imagination in the arts
a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part .
Gone is the tabula rasa of the mind .
There were more indications by the mid-twentieth century .
The line is a pretty good one .
People talk about `` the law of the land '' .
The expression has become quite a cliche .
They didn't seem to be able to think of any .
"Moreover , the law of the land is not irrevocable ; ;"
it can be changed ; ;
"it has been , many times ."
) and was repealed .
How do we define it '' ? ?
Is the consent of the governed a numerical majority ? ?
That regional peculiarities do not still exist ? ?
") , what voices would be left ? ?"
Who is involved willy nilly ? ?
Complicity is an embarrassing word .
But didn't they get off too easy ? ?
"they were the beneficiaries of responsible , paternalistic care ."
Who is the owner ? ?
"The slave is owner , And ever was ."
Pay him '' ! !
"Like Pilate , they had washed their hands ."
"But can one , really ? ?"
But that was a long time ago .
The New England conscience became desensitized .
It was nice to be able to isolate it .
Why should this be so ? ?
But I think that something more than this is involved .
they had less immigration to contend with .
And what a galaxy of those adorns that fair land ! !
Few writers have better understood their deepest selves .
Heidenstam could never be satisfied by surface .
"strongly colorful , plastic , racy , vivid ."
The young poet-painter reproduces the French life of the streets ; ;
`` The man's true reputation is his work '' .
"It slips away , it burns and tortures me ."
"He did not , however , find himself at once ."
From this time on Heidenstam proceeded to find his deeper self .
The general effect is tragic .
George Meredith has said that fervor is the core of style .
Of few authors is this more true than of Heidenstam .
Each is still glorified as a national hero .
"Like Napoleon , he was the worst of losers ."
He finds it in utter misery and desolation .
All his people ask for is no more war .
He had become king at fifteen .
Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling .
These are suggestive of Selma Lagerlof .
The record teems with romance and adventure .
Thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman .
He is an individualist but not an anarchist ; ;
he is a public servant but not a cop .
The private eye is therefore a moral man ; ;
but his morality rests upon that of his society .
"Unfortunately , this assumption does not always hold good ."
"If he is good , he may not be legal ; ;"
"if he is legal , he may not be good ."
Sherlock Holmes is not merely an individualist ; ;
he is very close to being a mental case .
His eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom .
These little problems help me to do so '' .
"Holmes is a public servant , to be sure ; ;"
but the society which he serves bores him to tears .
Why do the police find Holmes `` unorthodox '' ? ?
The great detective modestly agrees .
Poirot and his counterparts are perfectly respectable people ; ;
it is true that they are also extremely dull .
His alienation is far more acute than Holmes' ; ;
he is not an eccentric but rather an outcast .
His tough honesty condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence .
virtue is its own and only reward .
"For Sam Spade , neither crime nor virtue pays ; ;"
"moreover , it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two ."
Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest provides a classic example of this theme .
His successors have adopted the opposite alternative .
"For Hammer , nothing is forbidden ."
Networks illustrating some special types of organization
The numbers indicate the number of nearest neighbors .
Location theorists have given these matters much consideration .
"Without monitoring , a military hookup becomes a noisy party ."
The commands are specified by the military regulations ; ;
A military organization has an objective chosen by the higher command .
This objective is adhered to throughout the duration of the action .
A team for useful research .
"First , we realize that a pure specialist does not exist ."
I want to say more about Gabriel's so-called fundamental law .
But in every period it has been humanism '' .
"And let me add , utopianism , also ."
What had happened to the common man ? ?
I would agree with this view .
But I'm not here to define conservatism .
"This is , however , symptomatic of our national malaise ."
I suppose we might classify Billy Graham as an old liberal .
Adlai Stevenson expressed some reservations about this return .
Others invoked technology and common sense .
This group is secularist and their program tends to be technological .
What is the common man's complaint ? ?
Ralph Gabriel gave it the name of Protestant philosophy of Progress .
But there's a subjective side to that utopian outlook .
Should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us ? ?
Noting such evidence is the first step ; ;
But we cannot start off with a clean slate .
No amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts .
It serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that .
"The corporation has a limited , specific place in our society ."
"Such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot ."
It can project long-range goals for itself .
Proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control ; ;
"corporations , being more amorphous , cannot ."
Individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition .
The battle is not easy .
Its growth continues steadily on a par with past growth ; ;
and no limitation is in evidence .
"Criminals , as well as model citizens , exercise their minds ."
But clarity is not enough .
"True , ideas are important , perhaps life's most precious treasures ."
But have we not gone overboard in stressing their significance ? ?
Have we not actually developed idea worship ? ?
"Ideas we must have , and we seek them everywhere ."
We scour literature for them ; ;
here we find stored the wisdom of great minds .
But are all these works worthy of consideration ? ?
Can they stand rigid scrutiny ? ?
But was he infallible in all things ? ?
The Jew was the safest victim .
No Jew was on hand to boycott his financially struggling theater .
Who cares about them ! !
Shakespeare does not tell us that Shylock was an aberrant individual .
He sets him forth as being typical of the group .
but a Jewish heart .
There is no justification for such misrepresentation .
Are we better off for having Shakespeare's idea of Shylock ? ?
Does this help the non-Jew to understand this group ? ?
His name became synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty .
he is out of place in our times .
Is there some magic in it that assures results ? ?
In time she presents her aristocratic husband with a coal-black child .
Will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity ? ?
False ideas surfeit another sector of our life .
For several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship .
"That is questionable , to say the least ."
Most assuredly ideas are invaluable .
We have recourse to the scientifically-trained specialist in the laboratory .
Our presidential campaigns provide much debate and argument .
No holds are barred .
But have the results been heartening ? ?
Debate in the political arena can be productive of good .
it did not even provide the architect's plan for anything new .
they provide stimulations that lead to further production .
We would establish no censorship .
Only infrequently did the situation color his thinking .
About this man we had to think twice .
Thinking had stopped ; ;
it was not to be resumed .
On the most primitive level .
There is no socially existential answer to the question .
The first involves a simple shift of interests in the society .
Relativism and equality are its characteristic diseases .
Civilization is what man has made of himself .
It is not enough for man to be an ontological esse .
Change involves the displacement of form .
Both are predictably destined to fail .
The implicit assumption of this response is that history is reversible .
Reaction is rooted in a perception of tradition as a whole .
There is no selectivity ; ;
even the questionable features of the past are defended .
his tragedy seems unworthy and trivial .
The child dies with his mourning mother at his bedside .
Why does the story affect us ? ?
it conceals and yet is suggestive ; ;
It's easy to see why .
This love belongs to childhood ; ;
The young writer seems intimidated by psychological knowledge ; ;
the oracle speaks false and the dream speaks true .
the heroic act is the casting off of pretense .
Grigorss comes to Rome and becomes a great and beloved Pope .
and they had ( vaguely ) heads and feet .
Abstract art was still the right path for him ; ;
But his own work was evolving further .
He was engaged in constant experiments that searched for new directions .
Where would it all lead ? ?
"They were , in effect his last testament to non-objective art ."
He had taken out first papers for American citizenship ; ;
-- who questioned things when given orders '' .
during long weeks the plan for his flight was rehearsed .
As Helion wrote afterward : ``
Four hands were stretched toward me by my comrades behind me .
Marquet held my briefcase ; ;
Finot held a wallet with my money and papers ; ;
Moineau and David held nothing but their fingers .
They felt rough and kind and warm .
At this moment the volley-ball hit the ground .
Duclos ran toward Desprez with fists raised .
The guards all rushed up to intervene ''
It was a time of revelations for him .
Arp protested : `` But it is impossible ! !
"It was very widely read , too ; ;"
"If he is a traditionalist , he is an eclectic traditionalist ."
Faulkner is a most untraditional traditionalist .
To believe otherwise would be unrealistic .
His earliest work reflected heavy influences from English and continental writers .
"There would be side-conclusions to be drawn , of course ; ;"
"Each man , that is , is both one and many ."
What will be the final symmetry of the good society ? ?
For what do the utopians labor ? ?
Those who are insecure fear to be candid in self-examination .
Only the strong look squarely at weakness .
Mr. Lyford continues : ``
We would be ignoring the special circumstances of other countries .
They are determined to prove something .
The Introduction continues : ``
The host is the flowing life of the human race .
On occasion it produces extraordinary novelties .
the stockholder delivers his proxy ; ;
"Copernicus did not question it , Ptolemy could not ."
"First , the observational reasons ."
Ships disappear hull-first over the horizon ; ;
approaching shore their masts appeared first .
There were no reasons for such suppositions then .
Now what is perfect motion ? ?
"It must , apparently , be motion without termini ."
It is never motion towards something .
"Only imcomplete , imperfect things move towards what they lack ."
They move only in accordance with what is in their natures .
This gives a clue to the cosmical order of elements .
Thus earth has fallen to the center of the universe .
Pure fire ( the stars ) is in the heavens .
Their motion will be eternal and perfect .
Let us re-examine the publicized contrasts between Ptolemaic and Copernican astronomy .
"Bluntly , there never was a Ptolemaic system of astronomy ."
Copernicus' achievement was to have invented systematic astronomy .
He might even suppose the planets to move at infinity .
"His problem concerns longitudes , latitudes , and angular velocities ."
This is a mistake .
Ptolemy recurrently denies that he could ever explain planetary motion .
This is what necessitates the nonsystematic character of his astronomy .
Without careful qualification this can be misleading .
Calculations within the Copernican framework always raised questions about planetary configurations .
The latter required juggling several elements simultaneously .
But ' simplicity ' here refers to systematic simplicity .
"This characterizes Euclid's formulation of geometry , but not Ptolemy's astronomy ."
De Revolutionibus is not just a collection of facts and techniques .
It is an organized system of these things .
It provides exactly the same reason .
It is really the funeral day of scholastic science .
In what does the dissatisfaction of Copernicus-the-astronomer consist ? ?
What in The Almagest draws his fire ? ?
Geocentricism per se ? ?
"Copernicus required a systematically integrated , physically intelligible astronomy ."
The latter looked backward upon inherited deficiencies .
His feeling always exacted sacrifices from her .
From Philadelphia came Cyrus Adler and Joseph Jastrow .
"Adler , Judge Sulzberger's nephew , came to study Assyriology ."
But the March girls had their counterparts in the Szold girls .
Each was her mother's assistant and confidante ; ;
and each stood out conspicuously in the family picture .
Sadie studied piano ; ;
This time he was making no mistake .
So I got out .
Mrs. Wright is without funds .
"I am an attorney , not an instrument of vengeance '' ."
There were three years of this strange warfare ; ;
A troop of reporters brought up the rear .
' I think you had better leave ' ! !
And this is my own home '' .
You are even uglier than Mr. Wright '' .
But surely Michigan Avenue was handsome ? ?
"`` That isn't a boulevard , it's a racetrack '' ! !"
`` You are being strangled by traffic '' .
`` Cut off every building at the seventh floor .
You don't need concentration .
You'll have trees again .
You'll have some joy in the life of this city .
Later accounts blamed defective wiring for starting the fire ; ;
but Wright stayed in the United States .
But he was no man in the moon to me .
The flame was simply of a different kind .
Perhaps this is not so little .
One could see this chemical determinant as in itself a miracle .
I recoil from the very thought .
I can see us now .
"With scarcely a mumble of excuse , I fled ."
Cut it out '' .
But I will not skip it or cut it out .
Helpless in that sense I can never be again .
"Here , if anywhere , it is not wholly incontrovertible ."
But to me innocence is far less tangible .
With each song he gave verbal footnotes .
Sandburg is in constant demand as an entertainer .
Two things contribute to his popularity .
"First , Carl respects his audience and prepares his speeches carefully ."
It is not easy to become Segovia's pupil .
One needs high talent .
Segovia has written about Carl :
Nor does Carl reject this identity .
Carl hadn't brought his along .
Mr. Rosenberg suggested that they go out and find one .
`` But after introductions he asked : ' Carl Sandburg ? ?
Well you can pose inside .
This has always been Carl's attitude .
When fame came it changed Sandburg only slightly .
"That was all he said , Lewis reports ."
That was all he had to say .
It comes and goes .
It changes with every generation .
There never were two fames alike .
One fame is precious and luminous ; ;
another is a bubble of a bauble '' .
"`` Ah , did you once see Shelley plain '' ? ?"
it is a dedication which began the moment she met Carl .
"She was born Lilian Steichen , her parents immigrants from Luxemburg ."
But neither was Lilian her baptismal name .
Lilian Steichen was an exceptional student .
She had come to a decision .
Carl was still Charles A. Sandburg .
A letter awaited her at Princeton .
But they must have technical and investment assistance .
America did not become great through softness and self-indulgence .
a satisfaction in hard work ; ;
the readiness to sacrifice for worthwhile causes ; ;
the courage to meet every challenge ; ;
"Otherwise , the outlook could be dark indeed ."
America possesses an enormous defense power .
"Incidentally , there was an Atlas firing last night ."
This is necessary for a sounder collective defense system .
I believe it deficient in certain particulars .
Suggested improvements will be submitted to the Congress shortly .
Today our surging strength is apparent to everyone .
Yet we continue to be afflicted by nagging disorders .
It also implied that Paul Bang-Jensen had been irresponsible .
The method of destroying the evidence embarrassed Paul Bang-Jensen .
He had always done well .
"Never well known , but he had done his work competently ."
Gross had received Marshall courteously and they were discussing the case .
Marshall sat in one of the several leather chairs .
Gross swung his swivel chair .
"`` Well , how could that have been ? ?"
I don't consider that he was prejudged .
`` We have nothing to hide under a bushel .
`` What did you think about his mental state '' ? ?
`` This is a distressing thing .
No organization can carry on like that .
`` What do you mean '' ? ?
For an instant he glared speechless at Marshall .
"`` Listen '' , he said ."
You can find it in the papers '' .
Gross shot another look at Marshall .
`` It wasn't necessarily all here in New York .
Don't forget the foreign press '' .
`` Then what about the second interim public announcement ? ?
This cited Bang-Jensen's ' aberrant conduct ' '' .
He claimed you made other slanderous allegations '' .
Gross paused and repeated himself .
What was the list ? ?
Of course the matter caught the public's attention .
Hammarskjold didn't like the way it was carried out .
It was a sort of Gotterdammerung affair .
"as I understand it , Mr. Hammarskjold wanted outside advice ."
Could you comment on that '' ? ?
`` Those '' ! !
Gross reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper clippings .
The other was by Chesly Manley in the Chicago Daily Tribune .
Gross pointed to the Manley story .
"`` I know Ches , he's a friend of mine ."
That implies that Shann was on the enemy side .
You see what I mean ? ?
How it's phrased there -- the word violent .
So once again Shann had to argue with him about this .
But it wasn't a violent discussion .
Bang-Jensen was in `` hysterical condition '' .
"Gross stopped briefly , then went on ."
`` Shann was responsible for the report .
He has felt terrible about all this .
"When I speak of how Shann felt , I know well ."
"`` You know , this hits in many areas ."
It said in part :
`` This reveals some misunderstanding on your part .
The group conducting the review is not holding formal hearings .
"There , Ernest Gross further assured him :"
Fortunately the hole was found at last and plugged .
Another week passed and even the missionaries were enjoying the voyage .
The only lasting difficulty was the food .
Skipping was the alternative .
This is very uncommon '' .
She was now enjoying the voyage very much .
When May came the Caravan had already crossed the Equator .
They were sailing round the Cape of Good Hope ; ;
the weather had turned wet and cold .
He had brought it along to continue during the voyage .
There was one particular word that troubled his conscience .
even Christ was baptized by this method .
Ann was very troubled .
Baptists and Congregationalists in New England were on friendly terms .
but I hear the thunder roll ; ;
see the lightning flash ; ;
and the waves threatening to swallow up the vessel ; ;
and yet remain unmoved '' .
Ann was plainly disappointed in his appearance .
The pilot possessed excellent skill at his calling ; ;
Next morning the Caravan was out of the treacherous Bay .
Harriet was just as delighted .
Where were the hardships she had expected ? ?
The noise stunned her .
After that Salem ships decided to bypass unfriendly Burma .
Unspeakable tortures or even execution might well be their fate .
"he is answered by a confused , honest Englishman ."
Certainly it is the most pretentious and elaborate .
Their first collaboration came close .
But one afternoon Mrs. Mercer met her ; ;
both were obviously on the way to the Mercer home .
But Mrs. Mercer demanded more .
Young Mercer showed a remarkable lack of aptitude for both instruments .
There they stayed '' .
He has also an extraordinary conscience .
He died before he could completely pay off his debts .
While with the Whiteman band Mercer met Jerry Arlen .
Mercer has also written both music and lyrics for several songs .
There were times that he worked with both lyricists simultaneously .
He has a wonderfully retentive memory .
"`` Some guys bothered me '' , Mercer has said ."
He is probably our most original composer ; ;
This grew into the song `` Big Time Comin' '' .
I feel obliged to describe this cubbyhole .
Robbie was a war veteran with battle-shattered knees .
Mr. Herford's appearance was that of a frustrated gnome .
"The artist-author said nothing , but stood to one side ."
He waited a long time .
"Nothing was said , nothing accomplished ."
-- to go to the door .
Mr. Herford touched the fat man's arm .
"`` Pardon me , sir ."
I had had difficulties from the very first day .
Nor were his manners barbaric .
Why ' '' ? ?
It's bigger than the Armistice '' .
"`` I can tell you this much '' , he said ."
It's bigger than the Armistice '' .
And I was to go to work on that odd matter .
I shall tell of it later on .
"Mr. Baer had an auburn beard , like Longfellow's ."
"`` Where to , sir '' ? ?"
and also to change telephones .
He stood there staring with disbelief at the vacant desk .
He had a somewhat goggle-eyed expression .
He had been `` seeing things '' .
I would like to believe that my ability warranted this advancement .
Watson showed this wire to Colonel Van Hamm .
`` Don't bother to look any further .
We already have the only one of its kind '' .
Dr. Menas S. Gregory was another .
He brought her shawls .
He got her dozens of them .
She kept the dolls on the Lincoln bed .
It had a tiny envelope tied to its wrist .
The name inside the envelope was `` Cynthia '' .
John was away at school most of the time .
One White House dog was immortalized in a painting .
This is not true .
There is a long train flowing from the shoulders .
The last two were a red and a black chow .
Rob Roy remained boss of all the dogs .
Mrs. Coolidge chose Mama in her place .
It was a high mark for Mama .
They seemed to be at the White House half the time .
"If the Stearns were not there , grace would be omitted ."
He knew exactly how to be colorful ! !
You can imagine that he got pretty good service .
One person she helped was my brother .
"She wore grey every day , and white every evening ."
some Jews have in fact been all things to all men .
they have observed correct neutrality ; ;
they have been someone's enemy .
"Diversity of perception , yes ; ;"
"diversity of fact , yes ."
But the two do not invariably or even typically coincide .
But General Grant may have been self-victimized .
To some extent predispositions are shaped by exposure to group environments .
In some measure they depend upon the structure of individual personality .
These are personality factors ; ;
Many selections are themselves convincing contributions to this appraisal .
What shall these effects be ? ?
I am deliberately raising the policy problems involved in Gentile-Jewish relations .
What is the probable course of future developments ? ?
Social process is always anchored in past predisposition ; ;
the future weight of informal factors cannot be so easily assessed .
the process can be accelerated .
But simple involvement is not enough ; ;
Clearly what the person brings to the reading is important .
One would need to test this proposition carefully ; ;
"Scientists often turn out to be idiosyncratic , too ."
"But still , the proposition is worth examination ."
I do not know that this is true ; ;
Feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation .
Let us differentiate a few of these ideas .
"Here I do not mean catharsis , the discharge of emotion ."
"It is the obverse of triviality , shallowness , emotional anaesthesia ."
"I think these attributes cluster , but I have no evidence ."
Such study may take many forms .
The study of ideas in literature is one of these .
He will frequently return to it .
He may also consider ideas .
It is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy .
Our understanding will very probably require both these commentaries .
The actual moments of contact are vitally important .
This reading and the comments that it evoked constitute the influence .
Here an important caveat is in order .
"The Congressman tried hard , but failed ."
Hatred tied his hands in Congress .
He was the House pariah .
Even the regular Democrats disowned him .
Some preferred Judge Alton B. Parker of New York .
There was a host of dark horses .
His candidacy affected his journalism somewhat .
But his increasing strength in the West looked menacing .
But there is a Hearst barrel .
`` There's nothing like buildin' from the bottom up .
The Hearst dollar mark is all over them .
The talk of a Hearst `` barrel '' was increasing .
"`` Never mind , thank you '' , he said ."
`` I must hurry to catch my train '' .
"`` I'll show you '' , Hearst replied , grinning ."
Every letter answers itself in a couple of weeks '' .
The Hearst `` barrel ''
I have supported the Democratic party in the last five campaigns .
I supported Cleveland three times and Bryan twice .
Yet his editors did not abandon their sense of story value .
But the Garibaldi volumes were more than a romantic story .
"Characteristically , Trevelyan enjoyed writing the work ."
And Grey's Northumberland background was close to Trevelyan's own .
For once his touch deserted him .
His technique is genuinely masterful .
The result was fortunate .
Trevelyan's excursions into contemporary history were rarely happy ones .
The strength of the History is also its weakness .
His academic duties had little evident effect on his prolific pen .
"Of the three volumes , Blenheim is easily the best ."
`` May we come with you '' ? ?
Called out a dozen young voices .
That was all they needed .
They would champion me .
The real Franco-German frontier was beyond the town's limits .
`` I thank you most heartily for being here .
This is full evidence of your support for my principles .
I ask you all to support me in this .
I have full confidence in you .
"Now , let's go '' ."
"As usual , the press photographers were on hand ."
I took one step eastward .
`` Is this then the frontier '' ? ?
The waspish man stepped forward .
`` No line '' ? ?
Now I learn I cannot enter Germany .
Obviously I'm stuck on the line between the two countries '' .
But there is no question of a visa .
You are still in France '' .
The Interior man looked uneasily at his French compatriot .
`` There must be a line '' ! !
"And `` Bravo , Garry , continue '' ! !"
Asked a young mustached Frenchman .
`` It will be very cold '' .
`` I have a small sports shop in Strasbourg '' .
Her name was Esther Peter .
"`` Oh , Mr. Davis , are you there '' ? ?"
`` Who is it '' ? ?
"`` We're from the Council of Europe , British delegation ."
May we have a word with you '' ? ?
I heard nothing more .
He advised immediate hospitalization .
"`` No , it's not that '' , I told her ."
"`` But of course , with pleasure '' , he replied ."
Esther looked at me .
I looked from her to him .
`` What is your name '' ? ?
`` Jean Babel '' .
"`` Shake '' , I said ."
`` I am so happy .
"Now come , Garry , we must go quickly ."
There is a police car outside .
Maybe they will take us '' .
He never knew how he got there .
Six climactic minutes in an individual's life left no memory .
Eight field guns were captured in position .
Sherman laid great store by place captures .
Hood refused to notice anything except captured guns and colors .
By both standards Thomas had the right to be proud .
He supposed the military world would approve of his accomplishment .
Proposals were in the air for a year's armistice .
Lincoln was sure that he would not be re-elected .
To the Republicans no victory could have been more complete .
Official congratulations showered upon Sherman and his army .
"Lincoln mentioned their distinguished ability , courage and perseverance ."
"Grant called it prompt , skillful and brilliant ."
Halleck described it as the most brilliant of the war .
Actually the Atlanta campaign was a military failure .
The skirmishing was almost constant .
Rifle fire often kept the opposing gunners from manning their pieces .
The horseman required eleven times more than the footman .
So Sherman tried a compromise .
It failed to work .
This letter concluded with an invitation : ``
I am a great deal at the little children's Hospital .
Mr. Meynell knows the way .
I wish you would return them to her .
I have not the heart .
What has it all come to ? ?
All chance of fulfilling my destiny is over .
and launch them on the world when their time comes .
For them a box will be lodgment enough .
Katie cannot mind your seeing them now ; ;
"If otherwise , you will give me a pleasure ."
It is strange ; ;
Meynell's remedy for Thompson's despondent mood was typically practical .
"As a reviewer , Thompson generally displayed a judicious attitude ."
The Marshal came to know Littlepage quite well .
At General Headquarters the newcomer in turn got to know others .
Then there were the distinguished foreign volunteers .
From America were the Messrs. Littlepage and Jones .
'' So of course he stayed put .
Filigreed perfume boxes exuded the aromas of Araby .
He had collared one of his generals in public .
"When this happened , everything stopped ."
Woe betide the interviewee if he answered vaguely .
Suvorov's contempt for don't-know's was proverbial ; ;
better to give an asinine answer than none at all .
His breakfast was tea ; ;
his dinner fell anywhere from nine to noon ; ;
his supper was nothing .
Passing dogs were greeted with a cordial bark .
He had accordingly cultivated eccentricity to the point of second nature .
He had also mastered the Cossack tongue .
He always kept a few on his personal staff .
broad red stripes down the trouser leg ; ;
The little official hung his head in shame .
The doctor gravely nodded approval .
It was funny but it was also touching .
They are longing to see you '' .
My diplomacy was needless .
"Having completed our camera work , we started our climb ."
Will it live up to its reputation ? ?
And then perhaps one day we get to Athens .
We are here ! !
We've come a long way and spent a lot of money .
It had better be good .
Don't worry about the Acropolis .
The light at that time is a benediction .
Furthermore I can identify each design .
The columns of the Parthenon are fluted Doric .
These performances were being staged at historical monuments throughout Europe .
It was very stimulating .
They close sometime after eight .
Although open to the general public it is not overcrowded ; ;
One is Greece is not yet suffering from overpopulation .
The public may still find pleasure in public places .
Later they would be hoisted into place .
I think its thirst had never been assuaged before .
How can a cat be thin in a fish restaurant ? ?
But this one was .
This he claimed was the favorite refrain of the English .
"`` Let him become honest , and they discard him ."
The game is not worth the ammunition it would cost .
The strategy worked perfectly .
The anonymous correspondent did not resort to innuendoes .
He called Pike a thief .
Woodruff's strategy had been immensely successful .
"Once he learned a lesson , he never forgot it ."
"Besides being political allies , they were also friends ."
Then he called on the governor to explain why .
Woodruff was now impaled on the horns of a dilemma .
"As a consequence , he did neither ."
"`` Little Rock is a vile , detestable place ."
His artistic accomplishments guaranteed him entry into any social gathering .
He said Gorton was a holy man ; ;
Gorton and his family moved to Plymouth .
The report was : ``
A cow owned by an old woman trespassed on Gorton's land .
He was jailed and banished .
Roger Williams wrote his friend Winthrop as follows : ``
The settlement was called Shawomet .
Instead of that he was engulfed by bedlam .
Then Massachusetts switched to its standard tactics .
Governor Winthrop wrote : ``
Gorton and ten of his friends were thrown in jail .
The magistrates were determined to compel them .
Gorton replied with blasts that scandalized the congregation .
The Gortonists were charged with blasphemy and tried for their lives .
Gorton answered in writing .
The three others got off easier .
"`` I've been cooped up so long '' , he added ."
Papa was still elated over his afternoon visit downtown .
The hemorrhage was in the prostate region ; ;
Dr. Glenn saw at once what had happened .
"`` He has lost much blood '' , he said ."
`` It'll take a lot to replace it '' .
Let me give Papa blood '' .
They made the tests and came to Fred ; ;
"`` Why can't I , Doctor '' ? ?"
"`` Because , Fred , it could do him no good ."
It's too late now .
He's as good as gone '' .
And in a few minutes Papa was dead .
It was well past midnight .
A biographical sketch followed .
The burial was out in Riverside Cemetery .
And that's how Papa's estate was divided .
"But he had succeeded well , we agreed ."
For years Papa and Mama had been large taxpayers .
But he never expected to do that .
"And he didn't , by a long shot ! !"
"In fact , he didn't want to teach anywhere ."
And that's what he did .
That third year he wrote plays with a fury .
I think I'm right in that figure .
Later this play would be called Welcome To Our City .
It ran until past one o'clock .
That was Tom's weakness ; ;
"Tom never knew how to condense , to boil down ."
"he wanted nothing compressed , tight ."
"he despised parsimony , and particularly of words ."
I was drawn deeper and deeper into these concerns and responsibilities .
I engaged more and more in religious activities .
I went to an afternoon service at the Aj .
Much of this lacked the active support of the pastor .
"The young people were self-energizing , and I was energized ."
Meanwhile I myself was not yet saved .
"Finally , after years , I gave up ."
This doctrine was repugnant to my moral sense .
and the doctrine of original sin is compounded of injustice .
There was one further step in my religious progress .
"If obeyed , the law brings order and satisfaction ."
"If disobeyed , the result is turmoil and chaos ."
We can conceive of no alternatives .
Their basis seems deeper than mere authority .
Deity and Law are one and inseparable .
No one is to judge others '' .
For this decision a man must take personal responsibility .
or to let the ethical be superseded by the purposive .
Perhaps it should have .
My own experience has followed simpler lines .
Religion thus becomes integrated with life .
The Australian aborigine is the conventional exemplar of degraded humanity ; ;
Such is the field for exercising our reverence .
Let us now give some thought to the soul .
I asked one day what he was doing .
"Said he , `` It teaches me to wonder '' ."
This was a profound statement .
Wonder is indeed the intellectual gateway to the spiritual world .
None of these discoveries were neatly rounded off bits of knowledge .
Each faded out into the unexplored areas of the future .
His inability to wonder vitiates his argument .
Stephen Gosson and Sir Philip Sidney from renaissance England ; ;
Plato and Aristotle agree on some vital literary issues .
"In short , he is constantly concerned with the ethical effects ."
only the philosopher knows the truth .
"Poets , moreover , dwell on human passions ."
Both sides claimed that Plato and Aristotle supported their cause .
Many students of literature know that classical defense .
Students' choices of ideal educational goals are not arbitrary or whimsical .
The same patterned consistency shows itself in occupational choices .
"They also want money , prestige , and security ."
But they are optimistic about their prospects in these regards ; ;
The purely cognitive or informational problems are often acute .
But these terms are treacherous .
But the correlation is substantial only among upperclassmen .
"In this sense also , they are surely conformists ."
But the extent of ethical robotism is easily overestimated .
The `` cult of adjustment '' does exist .
Morgan himself had sciatica again .
Similar orders were given to the Maryland militia .
The redcoats ran like rabbits .
"Also , he was now forty-three years old ."
His soldiers on the whole did not celebrate so mildly .
These were Oneida Indians .
"On the surface , the whole question was purely feudal ."
This was Boniface's monumental tactlessness .
And yet he made no pretense about it ; ;
The Frenchman's answer was a terse `` Vous dites vrai '' .
This was a doubly bitter blow to the king .
It was a very tempting offer .
Time went on and everybody got older .
They were like two strangers .
Tessie could do nothing for Alfred .
She couldn't cook or clean or make him comfortable .
"Alfred knew that , too ."
"My father , a wise man , asked him not to ."
He knew Alfred liked me ; ;
Alfred was getting too sick to stay in his own home .
The doctor wanted him in a hospital ; ;
the nearest one was forty miles away in Kingston .
Meltzer knew why I had come for him .
For a few minutes there was nothing to hear .
Alfred was dressed for his trip to the hospital .
The car was waiting for him .
She didn't turn away from the window .
Alfred nodded a little nod and went out through the door .
Alfred looked straight ahead .
Speak to me '' .
But the car moved off and Alfred just looked straight ahead .
He stood there watching until it had gone from his sight .
I don't think he ever got to drink any of it .
Meltzer was a boarder with the Banks family .
He was a learned man and a very gentle soul .
He treated both with equal indifference and with equal contempt ; ;
Lilly Banks and I became friends .
Every chance I got I left the hotel to visit Lilly .
I helped Lilly in the store .
"When the work was finished , we would walk ."
Lilly preferred the loneliness of that walk .
It wasn't hard to understand .
To me Lilly was a fine and lovely girl .
And she had the kind of crossed eyes that shocked .
I accepted her crossed eyes as she accepted my childishness ; ;
Karl played well and his favorite song was a Schubert lullaby .
What was true for archaeology was also true of place-name studies .
It would seem that the wheel had turned full circle .
"Therefore , in one way Kemble and Lappenberg have been vindicated ."
This is nevertheless a minority view .
"Moreover , they have done so in rather special circumstances ."
Even earlier Haverfield had come to the same conclusion .
What exactly are we trying to prove ? ?
"it meant instead hardship , dirt , and death ."
from the General's idea a chain reaction occurred .
It was one thing to call men to the colors ; ;
"it was another to house , feed , and train them ."
The existing Army posts were wholly inadequate .
It was a gargantuan task ; ;
Baker moved first ; ;
This was the negative side of the situation .
But we abide by their insight .
Oedipus and Lear attain similar insights by virtue of similar blindness .
It is after the late seventeenth century .
To say this is to set aside the realness of time .
"But it is true , nevertheless ."
The reality of Orestes entails that of the Furies ; ;
the Weird Sisters wait for the soul of Macbeth .
"In tragedy , lightning is a messenger ."
It banishes the night wanderers to fire or repose .
Tragedy presumes such a configuration .
They are enacted at the heart of the body politic .
In La Nouvelle-Heloise and Werther tragedy is made intimate .
But one major fact seems undeniable .
Classic mythology and Christianity are such architectures of the imagination .
They are the essential force behind the conventions of tragedy .
"They are Descartes , Newton , and Voltaire ."
The romantics were the immediate inheritors of this tremendous change .
They were not yet prepared to accept it as irremediable .
It could not really be fulfilled .
Goethe used the fable to more elaborate ends .
Further letters in November mention that Sir Edward paid forty pounds .
and I was six days going thither and coming homewards ; ;
Here was another indispensable tool .
All of Adams' work reflects this dogmatic characteristic .
But it was nothing more than that .
The German barbarians of the fourth century offered an excellent example :
Doctrine was not only mysterious ; ;
Victor had led an adventurous life .
Then he began to have epileptic fits .
Of course it was not meant to be .
People and books are enough for them '' .
And that was the end .
He went to the Hotel Mayflower and telegraphed Mencken .
But not for long .
But none of this could soothe the exacerbated nerves .
Blackman had brought news from Kansas City .
In London Lewis took the usual suite in Bury Street .
Lewis himself furthered these tales .
Then they returned to their hotel and got ready for bed .
He evidently earned the place assigned him .
Recapitulation of Milton's undergraduate career
His other activities are not so easily recovered .
"A quibusdam , , audivi nuper Domina ."
It is not a question of truth or falsity ; ;
"Under their rule , earth becomes a technological utopia ."
Stigmata quite sufficient for diagnosis are nevertheless there .
Similarly the optimism of age protests too much .
"`` Boy , you ain't fooling nobody but yourself '' ."
We may say of some unfortunates that they were never young .
But at least the question has been raised .
I have changed and I have reversed opinions ; ;
With this excuse I have never been much impressed .
And I suppose it did .
I know that one must act .
`` How on earth do you manage it ? ?
What is the trick '' ? ?
there is no trick involved .
"Not really , it seems to me ."
It is not something that can be expected to happen now .
Despite these facts the question `` : :
Should no murderer ever be executed '' ? ?
and it should be far better known than it is .
"Nothing , however , could be farther from the truth ."
Here I am face to face with the primeval stuff '' .
What does the narrator see and what does he feel ? ?
"`` Oh , for the green of Europe ! !"
`` Something much more thorough is required '' .
We need joint chiefs of a political general staff '' .
Many factors contributed to the growth of the European movement .
"In other areas it held back , pleading its Commonwealth bonds ."
`` NATO cannot live on fear alone .
There is nothing new in this ; ;
Constitutions of and by themselves mean little ; ;
That is the lesson of the nineteenth century .
Even musicians themselves have taken to writing poetry .
This salvation does not take the form of a Christian Heaven .
Actually Heaven and the Dark Kingdom overlap ; ;
they form two aspects of heavenly life after death .
Patchen has almost never used strict poetic forms ; ;
he has experimented instead with personal myth-making .
These early experiments were evidently not altogether satisfying to Patchen .
His approach to music is highly individualistic ; ;
the accent is on improvisation rather than arrangements .
The musician is non-intellectual and non-verbal ; ;
His revolutionary anger is apparent in most of his early poems .
`` Anger won't help .
I was born angry .
Angry that none of us knew anything but filth and poverty .
"Oh , can't hold the han' of my love ! !"
Can't hold her little white han' ! !
"Oh , can't hold the han' of my love ! !"
Can't hold her pure little han' ! !
Neither of these poems is an aberration ; ;
Patchen is repeatedly preoccupied with death .
Let us see just how typical Krim is .
He is New York-born and Jewish .
Now he has abandoned all that to be A Writer .
I do not want to quibble about typicality ; ;
they sweated out some kind of formal education ; ;
they read widely and eclectically ; ;
And they traveled out of New York .
we were also literary ; ;
Some of us have imagination and sensibility too .
"Commentary was a mere suburb of Partisan Review , the arch-enemy ."
"over , the , country -- ."
This Partisan above all did ; ;
But it did print good verse and good fiction .
"the result was his inevitable bedazzlement through , ignorance ."
this moment are being bedazzled by half-digested ideas .
Those who have quality will outgrow `` the experience ; ;
Ideas are the thruway to nowhere .
The Italians felt it .
He was interested in Robert Musil's The Man Without Qualities .
So were a lot of other people .
He was interested in Italo Svevo .
This one was going to be different .
"Berto seemed worried , too ."
Berto knew all about Fascism .
"So did his friend , the young novelist Rimanelli ."
So there we were talking around and about it .
I thought : Who is older now ? ?
Old world and new world .
"The sculptor looked at him , bugeyed and amazed , angry ."
It was a picked assault company .
Object -- a village crossroads .
"`` Bullshit '' , he said softly ."
"`` Excuse me '' , the European said ."
`` I am not familiar with the expression '' .
There is a bronze wreath on the wall .
I have seen diapers strung across the ruined roof .
She had her reasons for this .
Therefore the government wanted no part of him .
And then there were other things .
I suffer from mixed feelings .
"He was a well-to-do , handsome , and sensitive young poet ."
"His bust shows an intense , mustached , fine-featured face ."
He was never heard of again .
"He was , thus , an early and spectacular victim ."
And there is something so wonderfully romantic about it all .
He really didn't know how to fly .
He had crashed on takeoff once before .
It was absurd and dramatic .
"No poetry , no airplanes , no dancers ."
She was from Prague .
She showed us what had happened to her .
"No airplanes , no Nathan Hale statements ."
There was a pretty thorough silence at that point .
I said I would do it for her .
"I had some reasons , too ."
I admire the English lady .
I also had and have feelings about Garibaldi .
So much for all that .
The English lady was pleased and enthusiastic .
The idea of the march pleased her .
"Maybe twenty , thirty , fifty ."

We can help in the planning process
it must express the nation's own will and goal .
We must use common sense in applying conditions
The reasons for stressing self-help
There are many others .
Aid advice is not interference
fiscal and monetary policies designed to prevent serious inflation ; ;
( B ) the reduction of dependence on external sources .
( C ) tapping the energies of the entire population .
"Otherwise , development will not lead to longrun stability ."
( D ) honesty in government .
Governments are rarely monolithic .
Development requires a long-term approach
This is not a short-run goal .
Most of our aid will go to those nearing self-sufficiency
Gradually others will move up to the same level
Aid is a long-term process
The specific reasons for a long-term approach
( A ) the need to budget a period of years .
( B ) the need to plan investment programs .
( C ) the need to allocate country resources .
The taking of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions .
"They must , therefore , be related to long-range development plans ."

Purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state purchases .
"Vehicle purchase , assignment and use policies ."
Automobile practices in other states .
Forty-seven states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state business .
"Two other states provide vehicles , but only with legislative approval ."
Fixed monthly allowances are a controversial subject .
"However , they lend themselves to abuse and inadequate control measures ."
Origin of state automobile practices
Those that are available shed little light .
And reasons other than employee need contributed to the growth .
This rate of increase does not signify anything in itself .
History and operation of the motor pool .
This responsibility included all phases of management .
Gasoline and automobile tires were rationed commodities .
Under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made .
The motor pool is a completely centralized and mechanized operation .
"Vehicle purchase , assignment , and use policies"
The Rhode Island property tax
Problems of taxing personal property .
Practices in Rhode Island .
"In two cases , airplanes only were indicated ."
Seven others expressed no opinion .
Ten others made no reply .
The need for greater knowledge is evident from their replies .
how and where to apply for financial assistance ; ;
details on marketing ; ;
"locating foreign agents , buyers , distributors , etc. ; ;"
among the operating departments of the state ; ;
between the cities and towns of the state ; ;
and on a regional basis between the six New England states .
and the preparation of the state development budget .
Special districts in Rhode island .
Fiscal years in other states
Fiscal uniformity : advantages and disadvantages
This greatly simplifies the town's bookkeeping and financial reporting .
The uniform fiscal year facilitates inter-town comparison of revenues and expenditures .
Towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare .
Any approach toward such a system looks toward saving and security .
One problem is a matter of shifting dates ; ;
"the other , is how to finance the transition ."
Little can be done about the changing of dates .
This is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars .
This will be covered more fully later .
Two features are immediately evident .
the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary .
The latter matter is considered in detail in a later section .
No change is required for these towns .
Adjustment of fiscal year .
Adjustment of tax collection year .
Both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars .
In many communities there is simply no financial problem ; ;
"Armed Forces Day Proclamation by John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor"
It is a sound investment .
Freedom depends upon them ; ;
"National Maritime Day proclamation by John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor"
"United Nations Day proclamation by John A. Notte , Jr. , governor"
The world desperately needs the United Nations .
Dances alternated with sung or spoken verses .
Ballets were used in opera from its beginning .
"Proclamation Thanksgiving Day by John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor"
"John A. Notte Jr. ,"

evaluation of histochemical techniques ; ;
and hip dysplasia in dogs .
Twenty-nine exhibits received awards .
Bandaging And Splinting ; ;
The American Registry Of Pathology
Eighty-five specimens were loaned for study purposes .
Thirty-five military and civilian students received laboratory training .
Armed Forces Medical Publication Agency
This agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals .
Laboratory measurements of interstellar radio spectra .
Very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable ; ;
extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported .
"This result is preliminary , and work is continuing ."
Pressure transducer for pvt measurements .
A prototype which fulfills the requirements was developed and thoroughly tested .
Transport properties of air .
Selected bibliographies and tables of available data are now in preparation .
Any agreement to the contrary shall be unlawful and void .
There have been a number of sound plans proposed .
But none of these has been implemented .
The New York Central notes : ``
The Central has pointed out .
Detailed studies of the plan were well underway .
"That is , will it serve the long-range public interest ? ?"
There is a new atmosphere of urgency in Washington this week .
next for Cuba : an arms blockade ? ?
How can the United States act ? ?
Blockade is one answer offered by experts .
Its aim : To undermine further Cuba's economy .
Among these questions : what would a Cuba blockade take ? ?
Land-based radar would help with this task .
So would radar picket ships .
the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it ; ;
and it must be enforced without discrimination .
What could a blockade accomplish ? ?
"Plenty , say the experts ."
Method of computing allotments .
Determine the particular State's `` allotment percentage '' .
Square each State's allotment percentage .
Determine each State's population .
Determine the particular State's unadjusted allotment for the particular fiscal year .
Additional note on allotments .
explanation of matching formula .
Method of computing Federal shares .
Determine the particular State's `` Federal Share '' .
Work on the roof continues in this way .
The structure is complete .
Bricks are an alternative .
The space between them is filled with pit-run gravel or earth .
Contractors' charges would be additional .
The shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection .
A contractor probably would be required to help build it .
His charges would be added to the cost of materials .
The shelter shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection .
Arrangement of the entrance .
The entrance must have at least one right-angle turn .
Radiation scatters somewhat like light .
Some will go around a corner .
The rest continues in a straight line .
A blower may be installed to increase comfort .
Lighting is an important consideration .
Other basement windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens .
The radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first .
A battery-powered radio is essential .
One instrument thus would serve both purposes .
It will tell you as soon as possible :
How long to stay in your shelter ; ;
How soon you may go outdoors ; ;
How long you may stay outside .
Families with children will have particular problems .
They should provide for simple recreation .
Records such as diaries can be kept .
Family rationing probably will be necessary .
Blowers should be operated periodically on a regular schedule .
Water rationing will be difficult and should be planned carefully .
A portable electric heater is advisable for shelters in cold climates .
It would take the chill from the shelter in the beginning .
"Warm clothing and bedding , of course , are essential ."
Open-flame heating or cooking should be avoided .
A flame would use up air .
If an attack finds you without a prepared shelter
petitioner was not denied due process ; ;
and his conviction is sustained .
Daniel M. Friedman argued the cause for the United States .
Mr. Justice Clark delivered the opinion of the Court .
The Court of Appeals affirmed .
The appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation .
Apparently he never took the trouble to find out .
But there are other contentions which might be considered more difficult .
He alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld ; ;
"Gonzales v. United States , supra ."
"Moreover , his testimony at trial never developed any such facts ."
Even now no such claim is asserted .
Foreign policy in its total context
Every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer .
There will of course be times for delay and inaction .
Dozens of seemingly small matters go wrong all over the world .
The problems of a policy officer
This means practically everybody in this room .
He must think about which of these principles must take precedence .
Which American ambassadors could provide helpful advice ? ?
Are private interests sufficiently involved to be consulted ? ?
Should the action be unilateral or multilateral ? ?
Respect for the opinions of mankind
May I add a caution on this particular point ? ?
This is an important consideration .
There should be no draft exemption because of Peace Corps service .
Rather the principle should be akin to that of the allowance .
"They should live in modest circumstances , avoiding all conspicuous consumption ."
Wherever possible they should live with their host country counterparts .
Some special health requirements might have to be met .
How and when should the Peace Corps be launched ? ?
Within a year or two several thousand might be in service .
What would the first projects be ? ?
How will the Peace Corps be received abroad ? ?
Our aim must be to learn as much as we teach .
How will it be financed ? ?
For this must be the project of the whole American people .
Is it worth the cost and the risks ? ?
It can contribute to the development of critical countries and regions .
It can promote international cooperation and good will toward this country .
To the Congress of the United States :
Protection from insects and disease
the protection of watershed lands from erosion and overgrazing by animals .
"Land adjustment , land purchase , land use"
"In some units , National Forest ownership is well blocked together ."
Forces and military personnel strength .
Quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere numbers .
"Procurement , research , and construction ."
I urge once again that the Congress not reenact this rider .
The agreement shall enter into force upon signature .
For the government of the United States of America :
for the government of India :
S. K. Patil Excellency :
It is understood that : ( A )

-- of new members through the Advisory Board .
The same is true of every foundation .
"indeed , the contrary has happened ."
The years of Joseph's partnership with his father were numbered .
One such man was Samuel Darling .
Need for sound tax policy
In December we began to ship our ultra-high-speed stretch yarn machines .
Many mills have already placed firm orders for this machine .
We look forward to a stronger position in this expanding field .
"Further research , we believe , will develop important commercial applications ."
"Production must be adjusted accordingly , at minimum cost and quickly ."
The Carleton Service Fund provides the financial support for this program .
These student-directed organizations include eight to ten members each ; ;
they perform at many campus social events .
Music is furnished by the Carleton College Choir .
Chapel services are held weekly .
Attendance at the Chapel Service is voluntary .
Religious organizations include the groups described below .
There are other organizations representing several of the denominational groups .
to encourage the practice of attending the theater ; ;
The workshop is open five afternoons and two evenings each week .
The group meets once a week in the Boliou Student Workshop .
They are assisted and advised by members of the Art Department .
The maintenance of Midwest Conference eligibility standards
Membership consists of both beginners and experienced players .
Membership is open to any woman student in the College .
The Alumni Fund Report in September ; ;
the Annual Catalog in March ; ;
an Alumni Reunion Bulletin in April ; ;
and a special Bulletin in June .
At intervals an alumni directory is issued .
) It is issued weekly throughout the college year .
on prospects for continued increases in defense spending ; ;
How well do faculty members govern themselves ? ?
"They , too , need to learn to delegate ."
by assuring good liaison between the committees and the administration ; ;
by minimizing the number of committees .
The cause is as often neglect as hesitance to disclose .
Great professors do not automatically reproduce themselves .
They evaluate and nominate candidates for appointment and promotion .
Physical plant and equipment can be efficiently developed .
Implementation of the master plan will inevitably be uneven .
Some departments will attack their new goals enthusiastically ; ;
others may drag their feet .
Funds may be readily donated for some purposes but not others .
"He cannot , of course , examine each proposal from scratch ."
A detailed energy balance of the anode was established .
The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount .
The cooling requirements are particularly severe at the anode .
The anode material was porous graphite .
Sintered porous metals should be usable in principle .
"However , technical difficulties arise by melting at local hot spots ."
It was exposed to a high velocity gas jet .
The power source was a commercial D. C. rectifier .
A high frequency starter was used to start the arc .
Experimental procedure and error analysis
Transpiration cooled anode with carbon anode holder
For each mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured .
Its temperature was denoted by Af .
The size of this hot region was estimated by eye .
It was denoted by Af .
This gives a rate of shear of Af .
These experiments can be considered exploratory only .
"This gives Af , which is the pressure ."
( C ) The kinetic effects are negligible .
This formula is given by Rumscheidt and Mason .
Its value was Af from the above data .
This means that work equals Q which in turn equals Af .
This is known as conformational entropy .
The paramagnetic dipole effects provide some information on the particle shapes .
We first discuss the Af bond in Af .
Indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects .
Douglass has studied the crystal structure of Af by x-ray diffraction .
This space group requires the hydrogen bond to be symmetric .
The separate layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds .
The gross details of the structure appear reasonable .
Plane suggested another preparation of Af which we used here .
Emission spectra indicated Af calcium and all other impurities much lower .
Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) measurements
Background spectra were obtained in all cases .
Second moments of the spectra were computed by numerical integration .
The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse .
light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; ;
Many scouring powders now also contain phosphates .
Cleaning or detergent action is entirely a matter of surfaces .
Also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general use .
The problems of hard-surface cleaning are not nearly as complex .
Greasy soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water ; ;
"Therefore , detergents are used ."
Freed soil must be dispersed and protected against flocculation .
Cleaned cloth must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil .
Reaction conditions and analysis .
Relative incident light intensities were measured with a thermopile potentiometer system .
In most cases the chlorine concentration was about Af .
The liquid phase photochemical reaction .
The photochemical exchange in the gas phase .
There are several possible sources .
Asteroidal collisions are also thought to contribute material .
There are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment .
Many other vehicles with smaller sensitive-area exposure-time products contribute some information .
The data show daily and diurnal variations .
The data have not yet been analyzed for diurnal variations .
Space probes have yielded little information .
To what extent such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown .
The velocity value used is also open to some question ; ;
"hence , these figures apply immediately above the Earth's atmosphere ."
The unshielded flux is given in the last column ; ;
The extrapolation may be in error for several reasons .
Indirect indications of micrometeorite flux
Biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon .
This area is highly susceptible to infection .
There are optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne .
It will rise during lapse conditions .
Spraying continued along a two-mile course .
A network of sampling stations had been set up on shore .
"Biological agents are , of course , highly host-specific ."
This may be of overriding importance in considering military objectives .
The question of epidemic disease merits some discussion .
Only a limited effort has been devoted to this problem .
A hypothetical example will illustrate this point .
Lousiness is a prerequisite for epidemic typhus .
A few obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned .
This is an enormous industry that is subject to sabotage .
In several instances group O cells were also used as controls .
All samples were tested by both the saline and albumin methods .
Other methods will be described below .
"the complete , in the latter part ."
"It is a happy , buzzing crowd ."
I will deal with these later on .
"Quite often , honeybees form a majority on the willow catkins ."
There must be several dozen species in the United States alone .
some show a definite liking for making their nest in moss .
She continues to add to the pollen supply as needed .
"Each now makes a tough , papery cocoon and pupates ."
The first worker bees do not mate or lay eggs ; ;
The temperature then is still very high .
there are other wild bees that command our attention .
The males are much duller .
Closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali bees .
I must plead guilty to a special sympathy for nomias .
yet the water in the ground should not be stagnant either .
They dislike dense vegetation .
Where does one find such conditions ? ?
Additional records of slow growth have been omitted .
data on the boa constrictor about match this .
"red-bellied snake ( Storeria ) , two years ; ;"
"cottonmouth ( Ancistrodon ) , two years ."
Measurements of skins are of little value ; ;
There are three levels on which to treat the subject .
This approach rejects virtually all field measurements .
Growth of the six giants
time required to reach maturity ; ;
rate of growth both before and after this crucial stage ; ;
"and maximum length , with confirmation or amplification of Oliver's figures ."
Definite information on the growth of senile individuals is lacking .
"At birth , this species varies considerably in size ."
A difference between subspecies might explain the great range in size .
I have little information on the anaconda's rate of growth .
In snakes difference in size is a common characteristic of subspecies .
This birth length seems to be typical .
The results are too varied to allow generalization .
Another marked difference is noted here .
No bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were noted in this group .
"Air-drifts from one area to another are , therefore , conceivable ."
"This relationship , however , is not maintained centrally ."
through the interlobular septa ; ;
The alveoli and respiratory bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues .
The lower portion necessitates only films of Hand .
his arrow crosses the line denoting the mean .
Little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of thyroglobulin .
Besides proteolytic enzymes the thyroid possesses de-iodinating enzymes .
Antithyroid drugs are of two general types .
One type has a small univalent anion of the thiocyanate-perchlorate-fluoro type .
It does not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as such .
The hormone has also been called thyrotrophin or thyrotrophic hormone .
Chemical constitution and physical properties of pituitary tsh
Two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in blood .
Standard preparations and units of thyroid-stimulating activity
Therapy included digitalization and anticoagulation .
No fasciculations or sensory defects were found .
Electromyography revealed no evidence of lower motor neuron disease .
Thyroid function tests yielded normal results .
A Schilling test demonstrated normal absorption of vitamin Af .
Serial serum potassium levels remained normal ; ;
These reactions were interpreted as being manifestations of hypoadrenocorticism .
X-ray films of the vertebral column showed progression of the demineralization .
"Microscopically , there was emphysema , fibrosis , and vascular congestion ."
There were slight fibrosis and marked arteriolosclerosis .
The submucosa was focally infiltrated with neutrophils .
Occasional tubules contained hyaline casts admixed with neutrophils .
There was no evidence of fibrosis .
Inflammatory cells were strikingly absent .
These were thought to represent regenerating fibers .
Trichrome stains failed to show fibrosis in the involved muscles .
The latter adhesive was found to be much more satisfactory .
As controls other sections were similarly covered with Aj .
The intermediate sera were also similarly absorbed with tissue powder .
The virus antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue .
These areas are thought to represent the nuclei .
Hypothalamic balance and its significance
"Obviously , a vicious cycle develops ."
The shock therapies act likewise on the hypothalamic balance .
They shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side .
On the physiological basis of some form of psychotherapy
Wolpe's experiments and therapeutic work lie in this area .
"Appropriate experiments showed that this is , indeed , possible ."
He then applied this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses .
What can we do with the general T ? ?
"First , T may not have a single characteristic value ; ;"
This is clearly a deficiency in T .
Thus T is not diagonalizable .
( primary decomposition theorem ) .
Let Af be the null space of Af .
Then ( A ) Af ; ;
( B ) each Af is invariant under T ; ;
The idea of the proof is this .
"For each i , let Af ."
Thus there are polynomials Af such that Af .
This completes the proof of statement ( A ) .
This shows that the minimal polynomial for Af divides Af .
"Conversely , let G be any polynomial such that Af ."
It is easily seen that Af divides G .
Hence the minimal polynomial for Af is Af .
Let us put Af .
Let us look at the operator Af .
Now Af Af so Af .
Let N be a linear operator on the vector space V .
We shall prove that Af .
Thus D' and N' commute with any polynomial in T ; ;
hence they commute with D and with N .
"if we take Af above , that will be large enough ."
) Now Af is a diagonalizable operator which is also nilpotent .
Such an operator is obviously the zero operator ; ;
Thus we see that Af and Af .
We now write Af where Af are distinct complex numbers .
"However , one does not need to know very much ."
"that is , Af , etc. ."
Thus Af if and only if Af .
We begin with a few examples of binomial experiments .
In repeated sets of five shots his numbers of bull's-eyes vary .
What probabilities should be attached to these possible outcomes ? ?
Aces ( ones ) with three dice .
On three Fridays the coach has needed a driver .
Each trial consists of choosing a student manager at random .
We now generalize these ideas for general binomial experiments .
The language and notation introduced are standard throughout the chapter .
There must be a fixed number n of repeated trials .
Experiment without a fixed number of trials .
Toss a die until an ace appears .
Experiment without the two-class property .
All trials have identical probabilities of success .
Each die has probability Af of producing an ace ; ;
Experiment where p is not constant .
The trials are independent .
Examples where independence fails .
The following is a less extreme example of dependence .
Consider couples visiting an art museum .
We want to study the probability function of this random variable .
The outcome of the experiment is X successes .
These are real analytic periodic functions with period T .
The points may also touch C without crossing .
Suppose Af crosses C when Af .
We now have certain squares with three corners on C .
The function f{t} defined in this way is multi-valued .
We consider now the graph of the function f{t} on Af .
We can now prove several lemmas .
We first show that the function is single-valued in some neighborhood .
In the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are Af .
The arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve .
"Therefore , Af is single-valued near Q ."
This set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals .
In the third category the function is double-valued in this interval .
Suppose Af is defined in the sub-interval Af .
"We have Af , plus tangent points ."
These s-values are just the ordinary values of Af .
The line Af is the image of L .
"Clearly , the transformation is involutorial ."
Hence C' is a Af curve on Q .
Thus it follows that the secants of **zg are all invariant .
These societies can expect to face difficult times .
old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense of direction .
They must continue to satisfy basic capital needs ; ;
Capital flows must be coordinated with national needs and planning .
There remain many political and administrative problems to be solved .
There are also more basic problems .
Some of the major functions of religion
There are several closely related inner functions .
Man is first religious ; ;
Religion seeks to satisfy human needs of great pertinence .
The universe is a safe and permanent home .
Death is not permanent defeat and disappearance ; ;
man has a second chance .
He is not lost in the abyss of endless time ; ;
he has endless being .
The two have never been separable .
Religion is vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation .
"for example , those regarding material objects and pragmatic ends ."
It places certain values at least beyond questioning and tampering .
Religion integrates and unifies .
Religion fosters group life in various ways .
Without a system of values there can be no society .
it enables members of the society to operate as a system .
Religion usually exercises a stabilizing-conserving function .
As such it acts as an anchor for the people .
"for example , the Crusades , mission efforts , just wars ."
and in modern societies such influence is still great .
"Clearly , this was a family in crisis ."
"there is room for you , too , Johnnie '' ."
This problem is perhaps as old as social casework itself .
One of the devices for tension management is preferential mating .
and core - Negro marriages are proscribed for core members '' .
Loomis considers ranking a product of the evaluation process .
Within the larger social system are the structural and functional subsystems .
"Subgroups of various types , interconnected by relational norms ."
Regulative norms governing subgroups and roles .
Subgroups of various types have been found within this system .
Each family line can be considered a substructure .
The present study relates to the theory of functional systems .
Integration `` has to do with the inter-relation of parts '' .
The population can thereby replenish itself and actually grow larger .
Loomis considers six such processes in his paradigm .
"This conclusion is , however , an over-simplification ."
Additional entries must be made from time to time .
So the results are subject to considerable confusion .
These studies vary widely in scope and precision .
The results are now being analyzed .
"However , the differences in procedure are fundamental ."
These teams carried out the same operations successively in different areas .
Different sampling ratios were applied under different conditions .
"( B ) residents , absent ; ;"
and ( C ) visitors .
The population registration system still has important functions .
It provides a frame for the sampling census .
But the weight of feeling was heavily in the opposite direction .
But only those already married could enroll in this one section .
This has subsequently been verified by the experience .
But in this one section we welcomed auditors .
This experimental class represented quite a variety of students .
"We already have courses covering those problems , and so on ."
"Our campus , unfortunately , owns no films ."
"Since the course , one member has lost her husband ."
Quite frequently class members brought questions from their mates at home .
This added a personal zest to class discussions and participation .
The three personality inventories ( Guilford ; ;
These were the same subjects who were given the Rorschach test .
They continued to give an arm-elevation .
I thought it wasn't supposed to '' .
"Therefore , third-grade children were chosen as subjects for this study ."
Administrative restrictions necessitated the smaller sample size in the structured schools .
Relationship of Anxiety to compulsivity
"therefore , we have measured two different characteristics ."
All of these sub-tests involve reading except Arithmetic Computation .
Scores are stated in grade-equivalents on a national norm .
test of interaction of compulsivity and teaching methods
Test of interaction of anxiety and teaching methods
But the symbols he is asked to learn are simple .
Each was told to purchase material if he felt like it .
This procedure was repeated one day a month for four months .
All applicants were generally familiar with the work of the receptionist .
He seemed to antagonize everyone .
"He admitted his behavior , and defended it ."
That's my job '' .
and `` cannot say '' if they were not certain .
No comments were made during the voting .
The results looked as follows : Af .
To learn what we do is the first step for improvement .
To want to change is the third step .
Roleplaying used for analysis follows these general steps leading to training .
Spontaneity training theory is unique and relatively new .
At first I did not know what she meant ; ;
I could evoke no further elaboration from her about this ; ;
She clearly agreed that this had been the case .
His subjective experience may be a remarkably concretistic one .
For English the reduction in size is less striking .
occurrence -- an instance of a form in text .
Let Af denote the form of Af .
the information cell Af is saved to represent the text occurrence .
Text reading continues with the next occurrence .
The address Af is stored in the cell Af .
Text reading continues with the next occurrence .
A third situation is possible .
"similarly , as many cells are added as are required ."
Text reading continues with the next occurrence .
The dictionary form is compared with each of these text forms .
These two steps essentially complete the lookup operation .
Only the assignment of the information cells is important .
This selection-rejection process takes place as the file is read .
This leaves the ordering of entries variable .
The tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end .
But the parallel is significant .
When the answer to what's wrong now ? ?
In what's a linguist ? ?
dominant stress will generally be on the subject a linguist ; ;
If the answer to what was that noise ? ?
Final adjuncts may or may not have dominant stress .
If the answer to what was that noise ? ?
They are likely to lose dominant stress .
Context is of extreme importance .
When a gesture accompanies who's he ? ?
"If women replaced people , it would normally have dominant stress ."
Dominant stress on pretty would be almost insulting here .
In is she Chinese or Japanese ? ?
Sometimes strong stress serves to focus an important secondary relationship .
In hunger stimulates man too the situation is very similar .
It has strong stress ; ;
`` I'll come by Tuesday .
I can't be happy long without drinking water '' .
And patterns of stress are not always unambiguous by any means .
Sometimes even the number of syllables is not clear .
"When ity is added , real clearly has two syllables ."
No single explanation is adequate to account for this .
The first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses .
The second need is better field techniques .
"As these maladies overlap , so must the cure ."
The third need is for better theory .
Actual practice does not often work out this way .
Welmers has suggested one explanation .
Tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed .
A third explanation is suggested by Richardson's analysis of Sukuma tone .
"Consonantal systems are not merely larger , they are multidimensional ."
The statement of the system is a different matter .
Smaller systems can of course be stated much more succinctly .
This restates the already widely known facts in terms of prosodies .
It seems to me that it rather easily can .
Five of the papers deal with grammatical problems .
My comments must be briefer than the papers deserve .
W. H. Whiteley writes on The Verbal Radical In Iraqw .
This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ;
The problem needs further exploration .
And why that insistence ? ?
Not that such a list cannot be constructed ; ;
That is his privilege .
"of classification first , with elapsed age merely a by-product ; ;"
He stood up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject .
"`` You would drive us into shame '' , he declared ."
Roosevelt acted as moderator of the long debate on this issue .
To Stalin it was a matter of life and death .
He made this completely clear .
This reasoning was also as inevitable as anything could be .
`` We were troubled about the fate of the Baltic States .
"Years of war , strain , and hatred ; ;"
The government was most anxious that there be a respectable response .
There is little doubt that the students benefit from vocational education .
An important recent trend is the development of area vocational schools .
Transportation may be provided from nearby school districts .
Courses are provided mainly for post high school day programs ; ;
"Again , one major difficulty is the local focus ."
Another problem is who will pay for the training .
This expectation is what really `` sold '' point and figure .
They are both trend-following methods .
"Of course , many more things are charted besides prices ."
The search for forecasting formulae is ceaseless .
The quest offers careers .
We mentioned odd-lot indices a few paragraphs ago .
The particular recipe is a matter of individual taste .
Which came first ? ?
And the converse at bottoms .
This element is often called `` strong hands '' .
Strong hands act ; ;
Strong hands move first ; ;
"weak hands ask , What is going on ? ?"
Membership in the echelons fluctuates too .
There need be no squeamishness about admitting this .
The method would become self-defeating '' .
Here would be a powerful force for raising business activity .
There is some clear-cut evidence of this .
Markets should become more competitive as consumers become more selective .
Price competition is lacking .
The demand for the industry's product
We are concerned with aggregate demand for the industry's product .
Union policies and collective bargaining issues
It is this conclusion that we challenge ; ;
Several factors contributed to this change .
"In both respects , international law was Europeanized ."
out of the question was the neutralization of Asia and Africa .
In the international community this reduced law to Jellinek's auto-limitation .
He no longer sought to find the law ; ;
he made it ; ;
but even laissez-faire was a conscious policy .
It was not opposed to either justice or morality ; ;
that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated ; ;
Government itself was based upon contract ; ;
even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement .
Serious difficulty arose with the advent of Substantive Due Process .
Such legislation was clarified and extended from time to time thereafter .
The classic case is Railroad Commission v. Pullman .
Its enforcement was enjoined by a federal trial court .
"Temporary abstention , i.e. , postponement , is one thing ; ;"
refusal to adjudicate is another .
this in the name of equitable discretion .
On its face this merely provides a federal forum ; ;
He will not be `` fooled by technicalities '' .
Federal review of state decisions
The result was that the plaintiff's case was dismissed .
The conduct in question was a speech .
A clearly recognized exception is a statutory merger or consolidation .
Proper evidence of the liquidation and succession must also be filed .
These results appear sound .

Reasons for selecting mail questionnaire method
It is recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent limitations .
There is also the problem of the respondent's frame of reference .
Preparation and pretest of the questionnaire
This test resulted in further revisions of the questionnaire .
"Accordingly , another test of the questionaire was made ."
Twenty-eight returns in all were received .
Three lists of companies were made and used in the study .
Fifteen hundred names were selected in this fashion .
Airmail was used for the addresses outside the Pacific Northwest .
The codes were key-punched into IBM punch cards and verified .
These attempts met with little sucess for a variety of reasons .
"Leadership was experienced and skillful , and financial resources were significant ."
"With respect to labor disputes , the Wagner-Peyser Act states only ,"
Referrals in labor dispute situations .
The packing shed workers go on strike .
There is no dispute involving fieldwork .
"So far , no troublesome cases have arisen under this provision ."
"( Incidentally , no Mexican nationals were involved ."
"We , of course , obeyed the court order ."
I believe I am in good company in this view .
The ramifications of the issue are enormous .
they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely .
The ability to think seems to increase consistently with age .
Children need help in learning to control their emotions .
Children differ widely in their emotional responses .
Among infants the patterns of emotional responses are similar ; ;
after the fourth year it begins to decline .
Why the teacher should study the individual pupil
Many school systems now employ school psychologists and child guidance specialists .
Factors that inhibit learning and lead to maladjustment

Two major types of fully distributed cost analysis
"Needless to say , any such inference would be quite unwarranted ."

"However , modesty and triviality are different qualities ."
"In this , philosophy and science share a common goal ."
It is not that such questions are not asked .
This is the course the positivists took .
They explained value judgments by explaining them away .
Now I do not think their view will do .
I shall argue that we do mean to do just that .
The attempt failed : the animal is now dead .
Consider what follows from the positivist view .
The pain of the rabbit was not itself bad ; ;
nothing evil was happening when that pain was being endured ; ;
The second argument applies the method in the reverse way .
Clearly it is not .
The positivist theory would here distort our meaning beyond recognition .
The pain in itself was neutral ; ;
The pathetic evidence is no longer before us ; ;
And this seems to me untrue .
I come now to a fourth consideration .
But that is not exactly my point .
"Now on the subjectivist view , this answer is ruled out ."
"Indeed , we are forced to go much farther ."
it would needlessly bring badness into the world ; ;
and even on subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright .
it would bring goodness into the world .
We shall consider these in the inverse order of their presentation .
at their edges they slipped pretty much out of focus altogether .

But here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation ; ;
we want to know what is perennially new about Utopia .
What is new about it ? ?
To that question the answer is simple ; ;
"it can be made in two words , Utopian communism ."
Surely there is nothing new about communism .
and it is to this problem that the Republic ultimately returns .
Utopian communism applies to all Utopians .
`` The soil is common to all men .
The Utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions .
It is not merely a new thing ; ;

Painting `` a secco '' is much in evidence .
The mortar was three parts sand to two of lime .
The new part is finished .
A second assistant mopped with two sponges .
The painting `` a fresco '' stood up superbly ; ;
a little of the `` secco '' came off .
Necessary retouching was put on at once .
"Altogether we found the craftsmanship first rate , especially Brumidi's ."
These frescos have had no care for eighty years .
I can well understand your curiosity .
Almost as if I were talking about something quite unreal .
Artists and poets are the raw nerve-ends of humanity ; ;
But today we were aware of only two men .
"To save time , some clarification seemed necessary ."

The Sane Society is an ambitious work .
Such books are easy prey for critics .

How widespread is alienation ? ?
Fromm seems unaware of these developments .
and today's trade unions announce pretty much the same view .
He seems to use the term alienation in two different ways .
"if they say they are satisfied , this shows unconscious alienation ."
There is nothing remarkable about this at all .
This is a delightfully motley collection .
The method of selection Fromm uses achieves exactly that .
"Furthermore , the list is interesting for its omissions ."

It is the difference between Bach and Mozart .
Thomas's ellipses and ambiguities are ends in themselves .
Emotionally it does not resemble Berlioz or Wagner ; ;
This is true also of a painter like Jackson Pollock .
Partly this difference is due to the nature of verbal communication .
It is much more a personal difference .
Ornament is confabulation in the interstices of structure .
Confabulation has come to determine structure .
Parker certainly had much more of an influence .

This observation too may have reference to Anglo-Saxon poetry .

at some stage in their evolution they were transcribed .
Anglo-Saxon poetry appears to have no comparable amount of repetition ; ;

Submarines and shore installations are new elements .
Fixed installations offer possibilities for area detection .

"A sixth element , not always considered , is intelligence ."
Necessity for an over-all concept
Thinking on submarine defense has not always been clear-cut .
These have sought more and more of what they have .
An over-all concept would have other advantages .
It would allow presentation to the public of a unified approach .
Now the problem is presented piecemeal and sometimes contradictorily .
The result can only be confusion in the public mind .
"Lacking guidance , industry picks its own areas ."
Principles involved in an over-all concept
Attack can come from almost any direction against many locations .
The next developments will probably be in weaponry .
The missile can gradually be expected to replace the torpedo .
No element can accomplish the total objective of submarine defense .
"Some elements support the others , but all have limitations ."
Conceivably the submarine defense problem can be solved by sufficient forces .
The world is constantly changing ; ;
what was new yesterday is obsolescent today .
The seventh principle of the plan is self-evident ; ;
Supporting elements in asw operations
Large area coverage will accomplish all other tasks .
These can be referred to as operational intelligence and environmental intelligence .
In submarine defense these must have maximum stress .
Environmental intelligence is just as important .
The ocean presently co-operates with the target .
All capabilities must be used to maximum advantage then .
There may be others .
These variations must eventually be measured horizontally as well as vertically .
Mine warfare has in the past been directed against surface targets .
Mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine targets .
Mines can be used to deny access to great areas ; ;
Effective employment will reduce force requirements .
Such systems are expensive and are oriented geographically .
The submarine has become increasingly attractive as an antisubmarine weapon system .

No comparable reductions in the cost of nuclide radiation are foreseen .
Present status of irradiation preservation of foods
Chief interest in radiosterilization resides in the military services .
Of primary interest are meats .
The radiation processing of meat has received extensive investigation .
"However , the problem of consumer acceptability remains ."
Competitive processes for preserving meats are by canning and freezing .
Results of irradiation tests with poultry have been quite successful .

High-gain photoelectronic image intensification may be achieved by several methods ; ;
some of these are listed below : ( A )
"Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems , ( B )"
"Channel-type , secondary emission image intensifier , ( C )"
"Cascading of single stages , enclosed in one common envelope ."
Channel-type image intensifiers are capable of achieving high-gain values ; ;
"they suffer , however , from an inherently low resolution ."
"However , the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts the effective gain ."

The gyro angular momentum is defined by H .
The platform is initially off level by the angle Aj .
Af is the scale factor of the accelerometer ( Af ) .
"Finally , the gyro-stabilized platform characteristic is represented by Af ."
The equation relating input acceleration to output platform angle is Af .
The system requires some switching of flight equipment circuits .
Manual leveling requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer outputs .
This process is especially difficult since gyro drifting is typically random .
External determination of heading -- surveying technique .
The platform accelerometers must be slightly modified for this procedure .
The transit can be replaced by an autocollimator .
The accelerometers are mounted rigidly on the platform .
Scotty did not go back to school .
"Rachel was polite , Scotty indifferent ."
His father tried to make the food a topic .
"`` The blueberry pie is good , Scotty ."
I recommend it '' .
"He looked at his son , his face worried ."
"`` He's all right , Craig '' , Rachel said ."
"Since his seizure , Scotty had had little appetite ; ;"
"yet his changed appearance , surprisingly , was one of plumpness ."
His face was fuller ; ;
"Even his neck seemed thicker and , therefore , shorter ."
"He looked lazy , spoiled , a little querulous ."
Rachel had little to say .
"She greeted her husband's colleagues with smiling politeness , offering nothing ."
"It was a strained , silent lunch ."
"Rachel said , `` I'd better get him to bed '' ."
They did not speak much .
Rachel had to bend toward Scotty and ask him to repeat .
"He said , `` Nothing '' ."
He felt tired and full and calm .
"`` You don't eat enough , honey ."
Try to get that down '' .
It'll take time '' .
He did not resent their supervision or Virginia's sometimes tiring sympathy .
His energy was gone .
his mouth hung slightly open .
He had not mentioned Kate .
it was merely another part of his weakness .
"He was calm , drugged , and lazy ."
He did not care .
"Scotty said , `` That's all right ."
Kate's all right '' .
She was with Elizabeth .
They were far off and looked tiny .
"`` Husky young man '' , he said with mock distaste ."
`` I imagine you're always battling in school '' .
`` I don't go to school any more '' .
`` Pardon '' ? ?
The doctor had to bend close to hear ; ;
Scotty said the same words more loudly .
"Well , we're taking a little vacation , that's all '' ."
He turned unsmilingly to Rachel .
He could now but the weakness is very definite ; ;
it would exhaust him further and unnecessarily .
He'll be stronger soon '' .
The stethoscope glinted silver in the darkening room .
`` I'll drop by again in a few days '' .
Rachel stayed on after the doctor had gone .
She did not touch him .
Scotty watched with disinterest .
He did not speak .
He had no desire to .
He had noticed how formal and irritably exact Rachel had grown .
He did not care .
He shook his head .
`` We've had any number of calls about you .
Miss Estherson called twice .
She wants to pay you a visit .
She says the children miss you .
Apparently you were the light of their lives '' .
`` That doctor annoys me '' .
She seemed to speak to herself .
She turned to him again .
"`` Well , Mrs. Charles -- Sally -- has phoned too ."
She was very worried '' .
Rachel's tone was dry .
"Scotty said , `` I don't know '' ."
"`` Well , there's time , in any case ."
We'll wait till you're stronger and then talk about it '' .
"Scotty said , `` Okay '' ."
This time Rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead .
His father was a constant visitor .
it floated up the stairs .
`` How's Scotty '' ? ?
And Rachel's or Virginia's reply : `` better .
He's getting plenty of rest '' .
`` Is his appetite improved '' ? ?
Or : `` Does he get exercise '' ? ?
"`` I'm eating more '' , he would say ."
Or : `` I walk around the house a lot '' .
`` Perhaps you should get out a little '' .
`` I'm not supposed to yet '' .
He was not irritated .
"He did not mind the useless , kindly questions ."
He looked at the lined face with vague interest ; ;
`` Have you got enough blankets '' ? ?
"There the objective sat , brooding over all ."
Was it all vain labor ? ?
Was this what he had expected ? ?
There was just too much time .
Time to become afraid .
"White's suggestion flattered , but he did not like the identity ."
He did not spill over with hatred for the enemy .

They were going to follow it for part of their journey .
On their right rose the embankment covered with brush and trees .
"Thus , stealthily they advanced upstream ; ;"
"There was no cover here , only grass sighing against pant-legs ."
"The warped , broken trees in the valley assumed wraith-like shapes ."
Somewhere over there another patrol had need of light .
White's arm went up and Warren raised his own .
The patrol was stopping .
Prevot came up `` .
`` Give me your machine gun ammo '' .
This he placed within quick reach .
Figures seemed to crouch in the surrounding dark ; ;
Pierre had no hands ; ;

But not in front of Trig .
There'd been a pretty bad incident back at the Marine base .

It was left out of him at birth .
This is why he made such a magnificent soldier .
Jane nodded with a pleasant smile .
Trig was one of the five volunteers .
You could hear them from our outpost .
There was a lot of shooting .
So we hurried over .
"Two of our men were killed , a third was wounded ."
`` What did the Colonel do about the men '' ? ?

Perhaps it was right ; ;
perhaps it was just .
But then his son could afford it .
Lawrence was waiting for Bill Boxell .
He said the matter was urgent .
The Secretary was uneasy about the visit .
He did not like Boxell .
He suspected something underhanded and furtive about him .

He waved his arm around at the furnishings .
"It was not a discourteous question , Lawrence decided ."
he had to find out .
I can do business with that kind '' .
Boxell did not have the chance to grow up graciously .
They had brandy in the library .
What are your weaknesses ? ?
Where will you break ? ?
How best to destroy your peace ? ?
Old Chris is my ideal .
What does a monk know about sex '' ? ?
You see what I mean .
Let me tell you what happened to me today .
"Literally , there was nothing else to do ."
He was caught in a machine .
Beyond were industries and factories .
Then they went down to Black Bottom .
But it was a landmark .
He sympathized with them on the loss of their old pastor .
He had no chance to say another word .
During the next weeks he looked over the situation .
It was dirty and neglected .
"Meanwhile , the city itself should be talked to ."
The streets in the colored section were dirty .
There was typhoid and malaria .
"The school was small , dark and ill-equipped ."
The teacher was a pliant fool .
the other exclusively Negro .
"Undoubtedly , there was a good deal of gambling in both ."
Wilson inquired about it .
It was called Kent House .
there were two or three colored maids employed there .
But nevertheless it looked respectable .
He was glad to have it there .
"The yards , front and back , were narrow ; ;"
"some were trash dumps , some had flower gardens ."
"Behind were privies , for there was no sewage system ."
He talked about it to the Presiding Elder .
The Presiding Elder looked him over rather carefully .
The Presiding Elder was sure that that would be impossible .
But he told Wilson to `` go ahead and try '' .
It did seem impossible .
The very proposition was sacrilege .
It had been here fifty years .
It was going to stay forever .
It was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject .
"By that time , perhaps something better can be done '' ."
You'll have to find out about it on your own .
Hope to see you again '' .
And he dismissed the colored pastor .
"`` No '' , said Wilson , `` I don't ."
I was just asking about it .
What is it '' ? ?
Wilson stared at her .
"`` My dear , you must be mistaken '' ."
"`` Talk to Mrs. Catt '' , she said ."
But this situation of Kent House was more subtle .
The wages involved were larger and more regular .
Payne dismounted in Madison Place and handed the reins to Herold .
Two gas lamps were no more than a misleading glow .
He might have been anywhere or nowhere .
Secretary of State Seward was a sick man .
The sick were always receiving medicines .
No one would question such an errand .
The bottle was filled up with flour .
Now it would have another death .
He clomped heavily up the stoop and rang the bell .
"It was still Good Friday , after all ."
A nigger boy opened the door .
Payne did not notice him .
He was thinking chiefly of Cap .
He pushed his way inside .
For a moment the hall confused him .
He had no idea where Seward's room would be .
Above him somewhere were the bedrooms .
Seward would be up there .
He was no longer worried .
Everything would be all right .
He knew that in this mood he could not be stopped .
"Still , the sensation always surprised him ."
It was a thrill he felt no part in .
The sound of his footsteps was like a muffled drum .
He stopped and whispered his errand .
Young Frederick Seward held out his hand .
"Panting a little , Payne shook his head ."
Dr. Verdi had told him to deliver his package in person .
"`` Very well '' , Payne said ."
`` I will go '' .
He pulled out his pistol and fired it .
It made no sound .
It was the first blow that was always difficult .
"After that , violence was exultantly easy ."
He got caught up into it and became a different person .
It was not murder at all .
Payne was more methodical than that .
A knife would do .
From childhood he had known all about knives .
Someone blocked the door from inside .
He smashed it in and tumbled into darkness .
Two men pulled him off .
Payne hacked at their arms .
"There was a lady there , in a nightdress ."
He would not have wanted to hurt a lady .
"Another man approached , this one fully dressed ."
"`` I'm mad '' , and only wished he had been ."
That would have made things so much easier .
But he was not mad .
He was only dreaming .
He clattered down the stairs and out of the door .
"One always wakes up , even from one's own dreams ."
The clammy air revived him .
"Herold , he saw , had fled ."
"Well , one did not expect much of people like Herold ."
The nigger boy was close behind him .
Then the nigger boy turned back and he was alone .
He rode on and on .
He had no idea where he was .
After some time he came to an open field .
"He felt curiously sleepy , the world seemed far away ; ;"
Cap would find him and take care of him .
"Violence always made him tired , but he was not frightened ."
That was one of the high spots of the play .
"The audience , as usual , loved it ."
He was delighted to see them so happy .
Wilkes was quite right about one thing .
Laura Keene had been in the green room .
The commotion had brought her into the wings .
She had been one of the first to collect her wits .
The theatre was hot and they were drugged with boredom .
At the end of the monologue the audience would applaud .
Meanwhile it looked at the scenery .
"Said Trenchard , otherwise Hawk ."
"There was always a pause here , before the next line ."
That was when the gun went off .
Yet even that explosion did not mean much .
"`` Sic semper tyrannis '' , it said mildly ."
Booth had delivered his line .
Behind him billowed a small pungent cloud of smoke .
They had not heard what had been said .
Harry Hawk still had his arm raised towards the wings .
He did not lower his arm .
This figure looked like the slave dealer from that .
Then it disappeared into the wings .
There was no mistaking that scream .
Yet this scream had a different note in it .
Her action was involuntary .
Mrs. Lincoln screamed again .
That got everybody up .
"On the stage , Harry Hawk began to weep ."
Laura Keene brushed by him with the glass of water .
The crowd began to move .
It would not give .
He went straight to the Presidential box .
Rathbone said he was bleeding to death .
By the look of him he wasn't that far gone .
"Once more , Katie reared , and whinnied in fear ."
"For a moment , boy and mount hung in midair ."
But the stranger was nimbler still .
"Katie reared a third time , then , trembling , descended ."
Stevie could feel himself toppling .
He saw the ground coming up -- and the stranger's head .
"With incredible ferocity , he brought his fists together and struck ."
The blow encountered silky hair and hard bone .
"Katie scrambled to her feet , Stevie agilely retaining his seat ."
"He gloated , and his lips slavered ."
He heard himself chortling .
Stevie was shouting triumphantly .
"Instantly , he chilled ."
They were pursuing him .
He was frightened ; ;
his fists clutched so tightly that his knuckles hurt .
"His mother was nudging him , but he was still falling ."
His head hung over the boards of Katie's stall ; ;
before it was sprawled the mangled corpse of the bearded stranger .
"`` Stevie , wake up now ! !"
We're nearly there '' .
He had been dreaming .
He was safe in his Mama's arms .
The train had slowed .
Houses winked as the cars rolled beside a little depot .
`` Po' Chavis '' ! !
"He came by and repeated , `` Po' Chavis '' ! !"
The room vibrated as if a giant hand had rocked it .
A dull boom and a throbbing echo .
"The walls bulged , the floor trembled , the windowpanes rattled ."
He raced to the window and yanked at the sash .
"The wood was old , the paint alligatored ."
A fresh breeze saluted him .
He put his head out .
ivy climbed the red brick walls like a green-scaled monster .
The clock which had struck presented an innocent face .
In the kitchen Mama was wiping the cupboards .
And the loudest clock in the whole world '' ! !
"`` I know , Stephen '' , she smiled ."
"He dressed , and sped outdoors ."
He crossed Broome Street to Orange Square .
The spire seemed to hold up the sky .
Stevie whistled when he passed these alien grounds .
"He was fortunate , and proud ."
-- and crossed the suspension bridge to Matamoras ; ;
"However , a boy's lively eyes might rove ."
Stevie saw no idols ; ;
it troubled him that he couldn't always see what Papa saw .
`` Where you been today '' ? ?
"Ludie inquired every evening , pretending that he did not care ."
`` He'll make a preacher out of you '' ! !
"`` No , he won't '' ! !"
`` Not me '' ! !
`` Somebody's got to be a preacher in the family .
He made a will and last testament before we left Paterson .
I heard them ! !
Uncle and Aunt Howe were the witnesses '' .
`` Will he die '' ? ?
`` Everybody does '' .
Ludie could be hateful .
To speak of Papa dying was a sin .
The figure was wreathed in an extraordinary luminescence .
Would Papa really die ? ?
For he feared the Lake of Fire .
he must pray to be spared .
"Not George , Townley , or Ted , certainly not Ludie ."
He would hear the Call and would run to tell Papa .
Yet how might he know the Call when it came ? ?
It would summon him once ; ;
"if he missed it , never again ."
He must not fail to hear it .
He was Papa's chosen ; ;
he dared to wait for the lightning .
Lightning could strike you blind if you were a sinner ! !
But he was good .
He clenched his fists and faced the terror .
Lightning might strike the steeples of the other churches ; ;
Violet whinnied from the stable .
"`` Don't be afraid , Violet '' ! !"
"He shouted , and was aghast at the echoes ."
`` Don't you be afraid '' ! !
He would save her .
"`` Don't you be afraid , Violet '' ! !"
The great spire shone as if the lightning had polished it .
The pointed shadow had nearly touched him .
`` Go on home '' ! !
Ludie screeched at him .
`` Someone'll tell Papa '' ! !
Ludie did as he pleased .
Ludie chewed roofer's tar .
A Newfoundland sat solemnly beside a doghouse half his size .
Stevie yearned for a dog .
She was taller than Aggie .
"They stayed at hotels and boardinghouses , or at private homes ."
That's how it should be .
It's those two fucken niggers ! !
"Krist , I wish they could write ! !"
"He thought of her , the first one ."
He had caught her coming out of the shack .
She was a juicy one .
Oh how they bounced ! !
"The snow came a little faster now , he noted ."
"He chuckled , the memory vivid ."
"Jee-sus , We Fixed him ! !"
"Yooee , we fixed him ! !"
If only the fucken weather wasn't so lousy ! !
"Goddamn niggers , Lord ."
What I have to put up with ! !
He ain't so bad .
His thoughts turned to other things .
But he soon saw which way the ball was bouncing .
Soon came back to his senses .
That goddamn redheader was the worst .
"But I told him , goddammit ."
That'll put the place back to normal .
Maybe it's a good thing it happened .
"Maybe they'll stop it now , once for all ."
Clean the place up .
They're doin it now .
I hear the whole bunch is croakin out in the snow .
They'll get the guys that done it .
Prickly twinges of annoyance ran through him .
A tune began to whirl inside his head .
One of his favorites : `` Guitar Boogie '' .
It came up again and again in the discussion sessions .
"Hired , hard lackeys of the Warmongering capitalists ."
"Not captured , sent here ."
You guys remember that .
Remember that He heard himself haranguing them .
He saw himself before them delivering the speech .
"That was really something , coming from Ching ."
"`` Really something '' , he said , aloud ."
"'' His arm moved swiftly , violently , once , twice ."
He felt intense satisfaction .
He was tingling within .
"Before him , mutilated , bleeding to death , they lay ."
It was as if it had been done .
"`` Bastards '' , he said aloud , spitting on them ."
"He halted , and looked around ."
Rivers of cold sweat were suddenly unleashed within him .
He tried to stifle it .
But the words were forming .
He knew he couldn't .
Somebody'll hafta start thinkin .
And he took heart ; ;
the final word came forth .
"Now he heard it , fully ; ;"
"The music arrived , taking him its rhythm ."
"But he isn't with it , not at all with it ."
No one is stupid .
That's what he said .
How he loathed him .
He was the guy what always goofed at Question Time .
Why couldn't they have dumped him off on someone else ? ?
"The music surged up , but it failed to check it ."
Who is the man to take His place ? ?
The guy with most on the Ball .
Most on the ball .
He turned to the window again .
A gnawing and gnashing within him .
The snow was tumbling down furiously now .
"Huge glob-flakes hitting the ground , piling higher and higher ."
"He stared at it , amazed , alarmed ."
The whole fucken sky's cavin in ! !
"Cover the whole building , bury us all , by nightfall ."
Maybe they already got them .
"Top dog , sleeping and eating right there with the Staff ."
"Ching , Tien , all of them ."
He whirled about suddenly .
"It was nothing , though his heart was thumping wildly ."
"`` Yehhh '' , said Coughlin , practically spitting on him ."
The man moved away .
They'll toe the line .
Less bull the more you can do with em .
Just about to get their asses kicked into hut Seven .
Plenty of room there now .
They'd cut their mothers' belly open .
Give um the works .
"See , he's already snapping it up , the dumb jerk ."
"Coughlin grinned , feeling supremely on top of things ."
He watched the snow once again .
It made no sense to him .
"`` You , Listen ! !"
-- name William Foster's Four Internal Contradictions in Capitalism .
Quick -- Quick -- now '' ! !
He stared out the window .
For Christ's sake ! !
The whole fucken sky's caved in ! !
It was that prick Coughlin .
Why didn't he drop dead ? ?
How did they miss him when they got Slater ? ?
Is this a nut-house ? ?
Am I nuts ? ?
Is this for real ? ?
Am I dreamin ? ?
From somewhere in the hut came Coughlin's voice .
`` How long did you study ? ?
"How long , buddy '' ? ?"
`` For Christ's sake '' ! !
"`` Don't Christsake me , buddy ! !"
C'mon -- 'mon ! !
"Automatically , Finnegan started going over today's lesson ."
Capitalism rots from the core .
That's a good one .
I thought I knew .
Why don't Uncle Sam mind his own fucken business ? ?
I'll bet both together did .
He snuggled into the blanket .
The log was spinning .
But he was not .
He couldn't make out what he was saying .
No doubt it had to do with the log .
Why should he be concerned ? ?
`` A learned man '' ? ?
The bandit laughs in his face .
He goes to the chief himself .
`` At what university did you study '' ? ?
"Could he have pen and paper , please ? ?"
He is in a hurry to write another essay against culture .
But at the same time how understandable .
This time as a musician .
But his facility in this genre was not great .
And for good reasons .
His operatic music had little merit .
He didn't believe them .
"`` Nonsense '' , he said ."
`` Heaven forbid '' ! !
"Cried the ladies , enchanted by his music ."
`` You must make an opera out of this material '' .
"Oh , the irony and the bitterness of it ! !"
Or at least appear to reject it ! !
But what else could he do ? ?
But now music too ? ?
That would be too much ! !
"And the fault , of course , was Rameau's ."
He couldn't appear as a composer now .
The ladies were delighted and Jean Jacques was applauded .
The ladies especially couldn't understand what troubled him .
"Bah , what was a contradiction in one's life ? ?"
Merely to satisfy the author's curiosity .
That would certainly be paradoxical .
But Duclos thought he saw a way out .
`` Your name will never appear .
No one will even suspect that it is your work '' .
To that Rousseau could agree .
But now what crazy twists and turns of his emotions ! !
And how anxious this lover of obscurity was for applause ! !
Imagine the honor of it ! !
`` What was your answer '' ? ?
"Jean Jacques asked , striving to appear unimpressed ."
"`` I refused '' , Duclos said ."
`` What else could I do ? ?
"Monsieur De Cury was incensed , of course ."
And I was certain he would refuse '' .
How infuriating all this was ! !
-- he had to play a role of self-effacement .
`` You can't go in that way '' ! !
`` Why not '' ? ?
`` Who is going to stop me '' ? ?
`` You haven't dressed for the occasion '' ! !
They pointed out to him .
"`` I'm dressed as I always am '' , Rousseau said ."
`` Neither better nor worse '' .
"`` At home , yes '' , they argued ."
`` But here you are in the palace .
And Madame De Pompadour '' .
`` And even more right .
Since I am the composer '' ! !
`` But in such a slovenly condition '' .
`` What is slovenly about me '' ? ?
Surely it would grow there whether I washed myself or not .
And fashion is the real king here .
He trembled lest his piece should fail .
Could he walk out in the midst of his piece ? ?
"Here , before the court ? ?"
Before the King ? ?
The rider from Concord was as good as his word .
`` They're a-coming ! !
"That's understandable , and I appreciate the sentiment ."
"The gun would fire or not , just as chance willed ."
"From above me and somewhere behind me , a rifle cracked ."
"`` Committeemen , hold your fire ! !"
Hold your fire '' ! !
One moment there was a man in the saddle ; ;
but I have no memory of that .
Everyone else was running .
`` It makes sense .
"`` I learned that now '' , I said ."
Three men were around him .
Dancing was no longer permitted in the streets .
The Bordel and other places of prostitution were emptied .
The slit breeches had to go .
Drunkenness was no longer tolerated .
John's first impulse was to denounce their blasphemy .
`` Stick to the preaching of the Gospel '' ! !
John stiffened in anger .
John's reply was like a declaration of war .
Every eye was on him as he began to speak .
`` What Master Calvin says is true .
"Philibert Berthelier , the son of the famous patriot , disagreed ."
`` Do not listen to that Frenchman .
John was quietly insistent .
Not even Varnessa ; ;
But he had to follow the light .
The white-clad trees stood like specters in the February night .
John recognized Ablard Corne and called out a greeting .
How grateful he was to such men ! !
John leaned upon the stone balustrade .
Below the moon-splashed world rolled away to insurmountable white peaks ; ;
above him the deep blue sky glittered with stars .
"`` How long , my Lord ? ?"
Sleep was difficult these days .
Severe headaches were frequent .
"Letters came regularly from Nerien , Nicholas , and Martin ."
He had Anthony and William to confide in and consult .
"John found it difficult , but he held him in check ."
His easy good looks made him a favorite with the ladies .
We will have righteousness '' ! !
Tears burned behind his eyes as he prayed and meditated tonight .
What is he doing here at this hour ? ?
Is that you ? ?
I came to warn you of a plot '' ! !
"John stood above him , his face ashen ."
`` Plot '' ? ?
`` Monsieur Favre just paid me a visit .
It is to be a trap .
`` What will be the subject '' ? ?
Anger and fear fused in John .
He asked to be appointed a preacher .
`` There is more to the conspiracy .
`` It was always the spirit with Christ ; ;
matters such as leavened or unleavened bread are inconsequential .
Geneva must remain a sovereign state .
We will not yield to the demands of Bern '' ! !
The firelight played over Eli's flowing white locks and rugged features .
`` What was your reply to that '' ? ?
Then suddenly a group of men and dogs circled him .
"He stood very still , his heart thumping wildly ."
The chinless Jake called .
`` Arianist '' ! !
A rowdy with a big blob of a nose roared .
`` Heretic '' ! !
John lifted his hand for silence .
His voice shook a little .
Somebody heaved a stone .
For an instant John was stunned .
"Before he could duck , another stone struck him ."
`` Let him be now '' ! !
`` We have taught him a lesson '' .
The crowd moved back and John started dizzily down the hill .
Fists pummeled him as he staggered forward .
He recognized the gesture .
He knew its meaning .
Now the face was his own .
It was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came .
What was he expiating ? ?
He looked out of the tent at the company street .
The rain dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street .
"This was the hut of Simms Purdew , the hero ."
The men were huddled in those lairs .
Adam knew the names of some .
His heart suddenly opened to joy .
Lemme tell you now '' --
"It was Pullen James , the campmate of Simms Purdew ."
Adam watched the moisture flow from the poncho .
"It gave the rubberized fabric a dull gleam , like metal ."
The street was again empty .
"The feet wore army shoes , in obvious disrepair ."
The gray face stared straight ahead in the drizzle .
Then the figure moved on .
Adam recognized this one .
"`` Slice o' mutton , bhoy '' ? ?"
She had queried in her soft guttural .
`` Slice o' mutton '' ? ?
Her name was Mollie .
"They called her Mollie the Mutton , and laughed ."
Mollie the Mutton was scratching her nose .
Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose in the rain '' .
The pattern would not stop .
It came again and again .
"He felt trapped in that pattern , in the repetition ."
Suddenly he thought he might weep .
`` What's the matter with me '' ? ?
He demanded out loud .
"`` Oh , what's the matter with me '' ? ?"
He did not know .
He strained to hear .
He thought : I am a Jew from Bavaria .
He had plunged into the dark woods beyond .
He had died there .
"He thought of Simms Purdew rising up , fearless in glory ."
In the pity for them his loneliness was gone .
Adam rose from the crouch necessary to enter the hut .
A pot was boiling on the coals .
`` Gonna give Ole Buckra all his money '' ? ?
"`` Yeah '' , Mose murmured , `` yeah ."
And look what he done give us '' .
Adam looked at the pot .
`` What is it '' ? ?
"`` Gre't big fat chicken , yeah '' ."
He licked his lips again .
Then : `` yeah .
A chicken with six tits and a tail lak a corkscrew .
And it squealed for slop '' .
"`` Fooled you , huh ? ?"
"It is the same ole same , tell me its name ."
It is sowbelly with tits on .
It is salt po'k .
It is salt po'k and skippers .
He stopped stirring and looked over his shoulder .
`` Know what Ole Buckra et tonight '' ? ?
Adam shook his head .
"`` Chicken '' , Mose said ."
Fritzie was on the couch reading ; ;
Laura was sitting in an easy chair about eight feet away .
"`` Y'all wanna walk -- walk '' , he said ."
"Then , gently , he shoved her behind toward Laura ."
Amy walked -- making it halfway across the cottage floor .
"In the darkness , she saw him stirring ."
"He seemed to be muttering , his voice surprisingly clear ."
`` 'nother minute I'd have been fine .
H'all should have let me do it '' .
Laura touched his hand .
"`` Yes , I know , Fritzie ."
I should have '' .
The heat intensified on Tuesday .
He and Irvin Moll were sipping coffee at the breakfast bar .
Selena was the wrong woman for these crudities .
"I'm honey only to my husband , understand '' ? ?"
Her speech was barren of southernisms ; ;
"Selena Masters , Joe realized , was her own woman ."
"`` I'm awful sorry about what's happened '' , Selena said ."
`` Maybe today'll be a good-news day '' .
She charged off to the bedrooms .
Moll took his coffee into the nursery .
Someone would have to remain in the office continually .
"McFeeley greeted the parents , then studied his notebook ."
`` Sleep well '' ? ?
Andrus did not answer him .
"His face was bloated with drugging , redder than normal ."
"`` Oh -- we managed '' , she said ."
`` I'm a little groggy .
Did anything happen during the night '' ? ?
"`` Few crank calls '' , McFeeley said ."
`` A couple of tips we're running down -- nothing promising .
We can expect more of the same .
Too bad your number is in the directory '' .
The three had little to say to each other .
Kidnaper spurns ransom ; ;
"Before that , he wanted to talk to the neighbors ."
"Outside , only a handful of reporters remained ."
The bulk of the press corps was covering Rheinholdt's conference .
The street cleaner had not yet been around .
then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor .
"No , they hadn't seen anyone around ; ;"
"no , they didn't know the Andrus family ; ;"
"yes , they had read about the case ; ;"
"They offered no opinions , volunteered nothing , betrayed no emotions ."
"By comparison , Fritzie and Laura Andrus were quivering fledglings ."
All four remained impacted on the sofa until he had left .
He had spoken to Mrs. .
Emerson the previous day .
each shrub glazed with good health .
Mrs. Kahler joined them .
Both were dressed rather formally .
Both grinned at the detective .
She was intimidated by the stove .
The gas flamed up two inches high .
They found the teakettle .
Several sections of a loaf of dark bread ; ;
a tiny cake of ice .
She appeared with the teacart and he opened the windows .
`` Do you want to call Eugene '' ? ?
A sleepy voice answered .
Eugene told him and he promptly forgot .
Nothing was said about hotels or train journeys .
They all three had another cup of coffee .
He realized that he had no idea where the telephone was .
Harold shook his head .
"`` Sabine called a few minutes ago '' , Eugene said ."
It was the most important-looking cradle he had ever seen .
Alix and Eugene on their wedding day .
"Mme Vienot , considerably younger and very different ."
"Professor Cestre , could it be ? ?"
Beethoven's Fifth was the one on top .
Da-da-da-dum Music could not be Eugene's passion .
"Besides , the records were dusty ."
He tried the doors of the bookcase .
"`` Call the Vouillemont , I guess '' ."
`` I guess '' .
"They looked , even so ."
"Barbara bought some cotton aprons , and Harold bought shoestrings ."
"Instead , they went on down the hall to their room ."
"Barbara asked , as they heard the front door close ."
"`` Oh no '' , Harold said , shocked ."
"`` Well , this is France , after all '' ."
"`` I know , but there must be some other explanation ."
He's probably spending the evening with friends '' .
`` And for that he needs a little bag '' ? ?
"They had Vermouth , sitting in front of a cafe ."
They could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days .
`` What is it '' ? ?
"Barbara asked , standing in the doorway ."
`` I've solved the mystery of the little bag .
There it is and there is what was in it .
But where do people go swimming in Paris ? ?
"That boat in the river , maybe '' ."
`` What boat '' ? ?
She looked at him in surprise .
"`` I know '' , he said , reading her mind ."
So something like this matters more than it would at home .
"Also , he was so nice when he was nice '' ."
`` All because I didn't feel like dancing '' .
"`` I don't think it was that , really '' ."
`` Then what was it '' ? ?
`` I don't know .
I wish I did .
"The tweed coat , maybe ."
The thing about Eugene is that he's very proud '' .
that is how the Jews prepare a body for burial .
In his concept there could be no one else present .
They would feel what Mary was undergoing .
"There would be no halos , no angels ."
"Now she was intensely alive , anguished ; ;"
her son was dead .
only what Mary felt for her son .
Mary would have to carry the human communication .
This seemed right to him .
"Visually , these approximated what he was feeling within himself ."
`` Not at all .
Each religion has its own tenets '' .
`` I am carving a Pieta from white Carrara marble .
I cannot accomplish this if you will not help me '' .
`` I am working for the Cardinal of San Dionigi .
I'm sure he would approve '' .
`` What kind of models would you prefer '' ? ?
"Not bulky laborers , but sinewy men ."
Rabbi Melzi smiled at him with infinitely old but merry eyes .
`` Leave me your address .
Sangallo studied the drawings and improvised a trestle couch .
Michelangelo bought some scrap lumber .
His first model arrived at dusk .
The model quite plainly thought Michelangelo crazy ; ;
only the instructions from his rabbi kept him from bolting .
Mary presented quite a different problem .
Jacopo Galli introduced him into several Roman homes .
they remained rough starting points .
When carving he was charged with spontaneous energy ; ;
The true surge had to be inside the marble itself .
Drawing and models were his thinking .
`` You're too clean .
Scrub the studio once a week .
"`` No '' , said Argiento stolidly ."
I was taught '' .
frequently he would take his leave of Michelangelo by announcing :
`` Today I go see the horses '' .
"He stumbled into the house , eyes burning like fire ."
Though the pain was considerable Michelangelo was not too concerned .
He assumed he could blink the splinter out .
But it would not come .
By the second day Michelangelo began to worry ; ;
At dawn Argiento went to Jacopo Galli .
"Galli arrived with his family surgeon , Maestro Lippi ."
The surgeon carried a cage of live pigeons .
The scant flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands .
The child was gone .
"`` It always comes in threes '' , she sighed heavily ."
`` Trouble never comes but in threes '' .
She would not accept the death of such a little child .
She disciplined herself daily to do what must be done .
Joel worked like a field hand in the afternoons after school .
Kate felt she had deserted the boy in her own loss .
She loved him and missed his company .
What it was Kate could not fathom .
"Joel knew what he was about , however ."
"`` Not this old fox '' , chuckled Uncle Randolph ."
"`` Whiskey still , my foot '' , said Joel ."
She was taken up in worry for the reckless old man .
He tended the new colts Beau had sired .
No one went much to the crossroads now except Uncle Randolph .
I think I've taken it about fifty times already '' ! !
Winking at Joel's look of shock .
In the next few days they had cause to rejoice .
Kate and Mrs. Tussle waited for letters anxiously .
"They had already lost most of their corn , she thought ."
"Kate greeted him gravely , uneasy with misgivings at his visit ."
"`` What brings you here again , Colonel Marsh '' ? ?"
I wish our doctor could have saved her '' .
"She asked him , seeing Juanita's eyes grow bleak ."
"`` As you know , General McClellan has been occupying Beverly ."
I am to go to Washington to serve with him '' .
`` When are you to leave '' ? ?
"Kate asked , watching them both now anxiously ."
"She sought Kate out upstairs , her lips trembling ."
`` What do you want to do '' ? ?
"Kate asked , uneasy at the gravity of the girl's dilemma ."
`` I could go with him .
But I am a slave ! !
"`` No , the decision is yours ."
`` I don't hear the music .
"I am getting deaf , I must admit it '' ."
`` Where is everyone ? ?
"I say , where is everyone ? ?"
Was it a birthday ball ? ?
When Peter had reached his majority at eighteen ? ?
David Cortlandt was tired beyond almost the limits of his flesh .
Ahead there was a stirring of sudden movement at a crossroads .
He pulled out one of them and cocked it .
"It was a grotesque hen , five or six feet tall ."
-- flapped as it ran .
Its groin was bloody .
Black strips of skin hung from it .
The horse shied at the dreadful thing and flared its nostrils .
David took a firm hand with it .
Then it was gone .
"He drove on , wary and shaken ."
The Sons were out tonight .
On the western tip of Long Island protruded Brooklyn Heights .
It commanded a view over Manhattan and the harbor .
They often threw tidbits overboard .
Across the bay the Palisades were heavy in green timber ; ;
their rock paths led down to the Hudson .
"Today , tomorrow , six months , even perhaps a year"
The fish hawk flew on and was lost from sight .
"Pensive , introspective , he ached ."
Now there was more to do .
He scratched his mosquito-plagued neck .
He hoped he was free of self-deception .
He knew that many were using it for their own ends .
But it did not matter .
He stropped the razor slowly ; ;
That some men did not want it he could understand .
"Unique circumstances would test us all , he decided ."
Injury and ingratitude would occur .
No doubt John Hancock would do well now ; ;
war was a smugglers' heaven .
Things like that would increase rather than be done away with .
Life was a short play of tenebrous shadows .
David began to shave with great sweeping strokes .
He was proud that he had never worn a wig .
"He felt cheerful again , refreshed ; ;"
"presentable in his wide-cut brown suit , the well-made riding boots ."
It is so easy to falsify sentiment .
The future would happen ; ;
he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much .
He began to pack the saddlebags .
Andrei remembered a Bathyran meeting long ago .
A fund-raising drive to buy tractors and machinery was launched .
Andrei remembered that his own reaction had been one of indifference .
Had he found the meaning too late ? ?
"When Alexander Brandel rose to speak , the hall became silent ."
This is our singular goal .
How we travel through the forest is for each man's conscience .
Where we end our journey is always the same .
This was how Alexander Brandel expressed pure Zionism .
In his heart he had no desire to go to Palestine .
"Warsaw is my city , not Tel Aviv '' ."
I am a Jew '' .
He ground his teeth together .
"I hate Warsaw , he said to himself ."
I hate Poland and all the goddamned mothers' sons of them .
All of Poland is a coffin .
The terrible vision of the ghetto streets flooded his mind .
What matters now ? ?
What is beyond this fog ? ?
Andrei's skilled eye sized them up .
They were not Poles .
He guessed by their appearance that they were Rumanians .
The Bathyrans were all gone .
From the moment of the occupation Lublin became a focal point .
He and Ana watched it carefully .
Lublin generally was the forerunner of what would happen elsewhere .
Globocnik built the Death's-Head Corps .
Sixty thousand Jewish prisoners of war disappeared into Lublin's web .
"Plans went in and out of Lublin , indicating German confusion ."
Lublin was their heart .
What was happening in Majdanek ? ?
His watch told him he was still early .
`` Captain Androfski '' ! !
Styka sat beside him and pumped his hand excitedly .
I thought you might get in on a morning train '' .
"`` It's good to see you again , Styka '' ."
Styka studied his captain .
He almost broke into tears .
"`` Remember to call me Jan '' , Andrei said ."
Styka nodded and sniffed and blew his nose vociferously .
`` I'm lucky that you were still living in Lublin '' .
Styka grumbled about fate .
Not a bad girl .
So we have three children and responsibilities .
I work at the granary .
`` I understand '' .
Styka blew his nose again .
`` Were you able to make the arrangements '' ? ?
I did exactly as instructed .
`` His answer '' ? ?
`` Ten thousand zlotys '' .
`` Can he be trusted '' ? ?
"`` Good man , Styka '' ."
`` Captain Jan must you go inside Majdanek ? ?
The stories Everyone really knows what is happening there '' .
"`` Not everyone , Styka '' ."
`` What good will it really do '' ? ?
`` I don't know .
"`` Do you really believe that , Jan '' ? ?"
`` I have to believe it '' .
Styka shook his head slowly .
`` I am only a simple soldier .
I cannot think things out too well .
I hated you when I first came in .
`` But we are neither blind nor insane .
The men of your company would not allow your name dishonored .
Why do we let the Germans do this '' ? ?
"`` I have sat many hours with this , Styka ."
"I've lost faith , Styka ."
But now I think I hate it very much '' .
The question frightened Andrei .
`` Please don't go inside Majdanek '' .
It was an answer that Styka understood .
Half of it dripped down his chin .
He washed it down with beer and produced a deep-seated belch .
`` Well '' ? ?
Grabski looked at the pair of them .
He grunted a sort of `` yes '' answer .
`` My cousin works at the Labor Bureau .
He can make you work papers .
It will take a few days .
Grabski slurped his way to the bottom of the soup bowl .
`` Orders from the Home Army '' .
Nothing there but Jews '' .
`` We get strange orders '' .
`` Well -- what about the money '' ? ?
Andrei peeled off five one-thousand-zloty notes .
Grabski had never seen so much money .
`` This ain't enough '' .
Andrei and Styka were silent .
She was getting real dramatic .
I didn't want her back on that broken record .
"`` I am '' , she said ."
I was crazy about her all over again .
It was the call of the wild all right .
We moved down Broadway from ginmill to ginmill .
It was the same old routine .
I hate it '' .
She got so drunk I had to take her home .
It was a walk up on Hudson Street .
`` What about Ballestre '' ? ?
I had to shake her to make her listen .
What about him '' ? ?
Suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic .
`` Precious and I allow each other absolute freedom .
We are above being jealous .
He's used to me bringing home strange men .
I'll just tell him you're my husband .
He can't object to that '' .
`` Well I object .
If he pokes his nose in here I'll slug him '' .
`` That really would be funny '' .
She began to laugh .
After all I'm made of flesh and blood .
I'm not a plaster saint .
Waking up was horrible .
We both had hangovers .
Eileen declared she couldn't lift her head from the pillow .
There was somebody else in the apartment .
I turned around with the percolator in my hand .
"Brown eyes , eyebrow mustache ."
Oval face without an expression in the world .
`` Joseph Maria Ballestre meet Francis Xavier Bowman .
Exboyfriend meet exhusband '' .
She gave the nastiest laugh I ever heard .
She was enjoying the situation .
Eileen was a psychologist all right .
Maybe he felt the same way .
I never felt such a lowdown hound in my life .
I couldn't face Thelma after that night .
She never said a word about the fifty dollars .
She added a postscript begging me to be careful about drinking .
That finished me with Thelma .
Trust Eileen to squeeze all the drama out of a situation .
What I did know was that Precious was always around .
`` Who do you think pays the rent ? ?
Precious had me worried .
I couldn't make out what his racket was .
Still he let Eileen treat him like a valet .
I never could find out what his business was .
He always seemed to have money in his pocket .
Now and then he would disappear for several days .
Poor devil he can't have been too happy either .
She just wouldn't listen .
Eileen seemed to feel the same way .
We still had that much in common .
The trouble was drinking cost money .
Eileen must have wheedled a little out of Precious .
Pat O'Dwyer looked like a heavier Jim .
He was a big thick beefy violent man .
The O'Dwyers were real religious people except for Kate .
Pat meanwhile was bubbling over with sentiment .
Greatest thing that ever happened .
Pat had contacts all over the labor movement .
Most of them were elderly men .
They weren't as well paid as they should have been .
For once radicalism was a recommendation .
Sposato couldn't wait to get me hired .
The things a man will do for a woman .
Hino was elated at the prospect .
He was to get involved in no arguments ; ;
he was to try to make no converts ; ;
he was simply to listen and report back what he heard .
Rector was often curious ; ;
often tempted to ask questions but he never did .
He was even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi wanted .
`` Oh '' ? ?
`` I guess it will be all right .
"`` This afternoon '' , the secretary said ."
"`` All right '' , Rector said ."
`` I will be expecting them '' .
He had something more to say .
Rector laughed despite himself .
`` Arigato gosaimasu '' .
Rector had no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission .
Rector asked him to move it for the time being ; ;
he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless .
A good initial impression would be important now .
`` How many pamphlets do we have in stock '' ? ?
`` Why '' ? ?
He told her of the visitors and then of his plans .
`` How many children do you have present today '' ? ?
She looked back toward the schoolroom .
"`` Fifteen '' , she said ."
"`` No , only fourteen ."
The little Ito girl had had to go home .
She has a pretty bad cold '' .
Do you think you can manage it '' ? ?
`` I'll try '' .
"'' `` Fine '' , Rector said ."
He looked out over the expanse of the compound .
`` Have you ever operated a transit '' ? ?
"`` No , sir '' , Johnson said ."
Konishi can help you .
You'll find an old transit in the basement .
"The glass is out of it , but that won't matter ."
It looks pretty efficient and that's the important thing '' .
He went on to explain what he had in mind .
He said he could do it .
The fish took the bait .
She could act and she could write .
Have you any objection to the following plan ? ?
There we shall be free and unknown ; ;
we can return the following morning
She opened his reply with trembling fingers he agreed ! !
And he would see her that evening .
Victory at last ! !
She had never sung better .
The casual seduction of a seventeen-year-old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison .
They passed close by the turn to Bishopsgate .
Alone with the fabulous Byron ! !
How many women had longed for the privilege that was hers .
"How was she to behave , Claire wondered ."
"To be passive , to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd ."
Mystery -- that was the thing .
In the bedroom she would insist on darkness .
With his club foot he might well be grateful .
The fire in the sitting room was lighted .
`` What about the bedroom '' ? ?
A cold supper was ordered and a bottle of port .
"`` Sex is overpriced '' , he said ."
"That would be Minerva , I suppose ."
Wasn't the owl her symbol '' ? ?
`` I'll tell you nothing .
"Frankly , I don't care '' ."
She was striking the right note .
"Her lips , moist and parted , spoke his name ."
`` Byron '' ! !
She sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom .
He drank slowly with due appreciation .
It was an excellent vintage .
He rose and went to the bedroom .
`` I am tired of sultans and scimitars '' .
`` How do you know that '' ? ?
`` I promised him I wouldn't '' .
"Alastor was published only to be savagely attacked , contemptuously ignored ."
Neither acknowledged the gift .
Only Mary's praise sustained him in his disappointment .
"`` A public of one '' , Mary echoed reprovingly ."
`` How can you say such a thing ? ?
There are some even now .
"What about that dear , clever Mr. Thynne ? ?"
I am sure he is in raptures '' .
`` There are other Mr. Thynnes .
Not everyone is bewitched by Byron's caliphs and harem beauties '' .
The lordly poet was at low-water mark .
On all sides doors were being slammed in his face .
Beckworth handed the pass to the colonel .
"-- The last six months , sir ? ?"
-- You heard me .
There's a lot of waste going on here .
It's got to stop .
I want to take a look .
"This is no damned holiday , Beckworth ."
"-- Yes , sir ."
Beckworth left the tent .
Below he could see the bright torches lighting the riverbank .
It stood some fifty paces from the edge of the bank .
A crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor .
Two slits enabled observers to watch across the river .
The plank floor was slimed beneath Watson's boots .
In the corner was the soldier with the white flag .
Watson hardly looked at him .
Watson had presented his pouch and been led to the bombproof .
The officer had told him that both lists must be checked .
Watson had given his name and asked for a safe-conduct pass .
"The officer , surprised , said he would have to see ."
He had peered through the darkness at the rampart .
-- We won't be too long .
"-- Yes , sir ."
He had acknowledged the man .
"It was easier to think now , Watson decided ."
The stiff figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts .
But he groped blindly .
His lack of success steadily eroded his interest .
He was conscious of a growing sense of absurdity .
"Hillman had written it all out , hadn't he ? ?"
Wasn't the report official enough ? ?
What did he hope to accomplish here ? ?
Hillman had ordered him not to leave the far bank .
To tell John something he would find out for himself .
Watson snorted and then laughed aloud .
"The soldier's voice was muffled again , stricken with chagrin ."
"He clutched the staff , and his dark eyes blinked apologetically ."
"-- 'scuse me , sir ."
-- Let's get out of here .
The flat-bottomed boat swung slowly to the pull of the current .
A soldier held the end of a frayed rope .
"Three Union guards appeared , carrying their rifles at ready ."
Watson stared at them curiously .
"Behind them shambled a long column of weak , tattered men ."
They crept down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats .
The crawling men tried to rise and fell again .
No one moved to them .
The third crawling man forced himself erect .
Watson looked for the fourth man .
He had reached the three passive guards ; ;
The guards did not look at him .
"The figure on the earth halted , seemingly bewildered ."
He sank back on his thin haunches like a weary hound .
Then he began to crawl again .
Watson watched the creeping figure .
He felt a spectator interest .
Would the man make it or not ? ?
If only there was a clock for him to crawl against .
Say three minutes to make it sporting .
"The figure halted , and Watson gasped ."
"Watson raced for him , his boots slamming the soft earth ."
The guards came to life with astonishing menace .
They spun and flung their rifles up .
One man dropped to his knee for better aim .
"Watson pounded to the crawling man and stopped , panting heavily ."
Watson bent awkwardly and lifted the man to his feet .
Watson stared into a cadaverous face .
Two clotted balls the color of mucus rolled between fiery lids .
"The man's voice was a sweet , patient whisper ."
But you ain't Henry .
-- It don't matter .
Is it far ? ?
-- You talk deep .
Not like us fellas .
"It raises the voice , bein in camp ."
"Come on , now ."
Can you walk ? ?
"-- Why , course I can ."
I can walk real good .
Watson stumbled down the bank .
The man leaned his frail body against Watson's shoulder .
He was no heavier than a child .
Watson paused for breath .
His sweet whisper came after great effort .
"-- Oh , Christ ."
I wish you was Henry .
He promised to take me .
He heard the patient voice calling .
"Where are you , Henry ? ?"
-- Make him lie down ! !
Watson snatched a deep breath .
He had not meant to shout .
He stood with his back to the skiff .
"The men mewed and scratched , begging to be taken away ."
Watson spoke bewilderedly to the dark night flecked with pine-knot torches .
-- Goddamn you ! !
What do you do to them ? ?
Intelligence jabbed at him accusingly .
"He was angry , sickened ."
He had not felt that during the afternoon .
"No , nor later ."
"All his emotions had been inward , self-conscious ."
He was sure of it .
John's type of man allowed this sort of thing to happen .
So Charles was dead .
What did it matter ? ?
His name had been crossed off a list .
Already his cool body lay in the ground .
What words had any meaning ? ?
What right had John to any special consideration ? ?
"Was John better , more deserving ? ?"
He believed that brave boys didn't cry .
Watson spat on the ground .
He was grimly satisfied .
He had stupidly thought himself compelled to ease his brother's pain .
I can see it from this window where I write .
It would have been like her .
She was a pale woman .
It was the day to canvass for infectious hepatitis .
Mrs. Balcolm worked for the brain .
Mrs. Ten Eyke did mental health .
Mrs. Trenchard worked for the blind .
It was her destiny ; ;
it was her life .
But the Blevins were away ; ;
"`` Infectious hepatitis '' , he shouted heartily ."
"`` Oh , please come in '' , she said ."
The girlish voice was nearly a whisper .
"She was not a girl , he could see ."
"Where was Mr. Flannagan , he wondered ."
Travelling home on a late train ? ?
Changing his clothes upstairs ? ?
Taking a shower ? ?
Everything's on the table '' .
`` What train does Mr. Flannagan come out on '' ? ?
"`` Mr. Flannagan is away '' , she said ."
`` Mr. Flannagan has been away for six weeks .
`` If you will promise to make it weak '' .
The only way to find things is to relax '' .
"All in all , they had six drinks ."
She described herself and her circumstances unhesitatingly .
Mr. Flannagan manufactured plastic tongue depressors .
He travelled all over the world .
She didn't like to travel .
She had no children ; ;
she had made no friends .
"Her voice shook with feeling , and he thought it lovely ."
`` Where have you been '' ? ?
"Mrs. Pastern asked sadly , when he came in ."
`` It's after eleven '' .
`` I had a drink with the Flannagans '' .
`` She told me he was in Germany '' .
`` He came home unexpectedly '' .
`` Bomb them '' ! !
`` Throw a little nuclear hardware at them ! !
Show them who's boss '' ! !
But in bed he had trouble sleeping .
Her thoughts were not discrete .
To Mark : `` Please give my regards to Myra '' .
"`` You remember them , I suppose '' ? ?"
She glinted suspiciously at the dish before her : `` blowfish .
I hope Raphael bought them whole '' .
"Angelina stepped back , her eyes roaming the tray for omissions ."
The name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lips .
She would have said triumph .
then she snorted and groped for her fork .
And indeed the young garden beans were brackish in her mouth .
She was the last living of the older generation .
"The girl , her first , she barely remembered ."
But the boy the boy had been alive yesterday .
"That is what childhood is , he told himself ."
"Solid , settled lost ."
The boyhood summers preceding their uncle's funeral might never have been .
The small car flew on relentlessly .
Abel moved and adjusted his long legs .
Now Abel turned his head to look at his brother .
The vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they approached the sea .
"They've never met , you know ."
But Myra wouldn't budge without an express invitation .
I feel kind of bad about it '' .
Abel ignored the half-expressed bid for confirmation .
It was barely possible that his brother was right .
He could tell they were approaching the sea .
`` Remember the Starbird ? ?
"`` The Starbird , '' Abel said ."
The Starbird had been long at the bottom of the bay .
They came unexpectedly upon the sea .
Oh he'd not care about the Pedersen kid .
That would make him mad enough if he was sober .
He was all shoveled up like I thought he'd be .
"I pushed at his shoulder , calling his name ."
I couldn't be sure he was still asleep .
He was a cagey sonofabitch .
I shook him a little harder and made some noise .
"`` Pap-pap-pap-hey '' , I said ."
I was leaning too far over .
Oh he was smart .
It put you off .
"It was better , though , he'd hit me ."
He was bitter when he missed .
`` Big Hans sent me .
He told me to wake you '' .
Get out of here '' .
`` He found the Pedersen kid by the crib '' .
Pa pulled at the covers .
He was tasting his mouth .
`` The kid's froze good .
Hans is rubbing him with snow .
He's got him in the kitchen '' .
`` Pedersen '' ? ?
"`` No , Pa ."
It's the Pedersen kid .
`` Nothing to steal from the crib '' .
"`` Not stealing , Pa ."
He was just lying there .
Hans found him froze .
That's where he was when Hans found him '' .
`` I ain't hid nothing in the crib '' .
"`` You don't understand , Pa ."
`` I goddamn well understand '' .
`` I goddamn well understand .
You know I don't want to see Pedersen .
Why should I ? ?
"What did he come for , hey ? ?"
And don't come back .
Both you and Hans .
He had long black hairs on his wrist .
They curled around the cuff of his nightshirt .
`` Big Hans made me come .
Big Hans said '' --
He's an even bigger fool than you are .
"Fat , hey ? ?"
"I taught him , dammit , and I'll teach you ."
You want me to drop my pot '' ? ?
He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep .
Then he threw things .
Hans got an axe .
I heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs .
Hans had laid steaming towels over the kid's chest and stomach .
He was rubbing snow on the kid's legs and feet .
`` Ain't he going to wake up '' ? ?
`` What about your pa '' ? ?
`` He was awake when I left '' .
`` What'd he say ? ?
Did you get the whisky '' ? ?
`` Don't be smart .
Did you ask him about the whisky '' ? ?
`` Well '' ? ?
`` Don't be smart .
What's he going to do '' ? ?
`` Go back to sleep most likely '' .
`` You'd best get that whisky '' .
This kid's froze bad .
If I don't get some whisky down him he might die .
You want the kid to die ? ?
"Well , get your pa and get that whisky '' ."
`` Pa don't care about the kid '' .
`` Well he don't .
He don't care about anybody .
Get pig-drunk -- that's what he wants .
He don't care about nothing else at all .
Not Pedersen's kid neither .
Not the kid neither '' .
"`` I'll get the spirits '' , Ma said ."
I'd wound Big Hans up tight .
"`` No you won't '' , Big Hans said ."
Hans rubbed the kid with more snow rubbed rubbed .
"`` I'll get more snow '' , I said ."
I don't know where Ma went .
I thought she'd gone upstairs and expected to hear she had .
There was no way of getting even .
It wasn't like getting cheated at the fair .
They were always trying so you got to expect it .
Hans cut the foil off finally and unscrewed the cap .
Ma had found one of Pa's hiding places .
Pa had a knack for hiding .
He knew we were looking and he enjoyed it .
Pa was sure to find out .
A fool could see what was going on .
If he found out Ma found it -- that'd be bad .
He took pride in his hiding .
It was all the pride he had .
I guess fooling Hans and me took doing .
But he didn't figure Ma for much .
Hans poured some in a tumbler .
`` You going to put more towels on him '' ? ?
`` Why not ? ?
`` Not where he's froze good .
Heat's bad for frostbite .
That's why I only put towels on his chest and belly .
He's got to thaw slow .
You ought to know that '' .
Colors on the towels had run .
Ma poked her toe in the kid's clothes .
`` What are we going to do with these '' ? ?
"`` Here , help me prop him up ."
I got hold his mouth open '' .
"`` Come on , Jorge '' ."
`` All right '' .
"`` Lift , don't shove lift '' ."
"`` O.K. , I'm lifting '' ."
I took him by the shoulders .
His head flopped back .
His mouth fell open .
The skin on his neck was tight .
He was cold all right .
`` Hold his head up .
`` His mouth is open '' .
`` His throat's shut .
`` He'll choke anyway '' .
`` Hold his head up '' .
`` I can't '' .
`` Don't hold him like that .
Put your arms around him '' .
He was cold all right .
I put my arm carefully around him .
Hans had his fingers in the kid's mouth .
`` Now he'll choke for sure '' .
Just hold him like I told you '' .
"He was cold all right , and wet ."
I had my arm behind his back .
it was always the same unqualified success now .
The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere ; ;
But he was not bored at all ; ;
But he was too busy to hear what she was saying .
So they parted when she was in an impatient humor .
He kept on laughing until she started laughing with him .
an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it .
He would settle himself into his seat to laugh .
Whenever he laughed it was all he was doing .
improvise cha-chas on the harp ; ;
She knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at herself .
Enjoy being a bride while you can '' .
And there was still not anything that Linda Kay could do .
"So Linda Kay gave up asking , and accepted her reprieve ."
"Without saying so , she was really grateful ; ;"
"Not that she complained , or had any cause to ."
There was no reason for her to ask what they did .
So the pattern was established .
And sit on the porch a while .
The women and children stayed at the Albrights' .
"There was much embracing , much exclaiming ."
`` Cousin Ada ! !
Cousin John '' ! !
`` Cousin Lura '' ! !
`` Cousin Howard '' ! !
`` And how is she '' ? ?
"`` About the same , John , about the same '' ."
We came on as soon as we could '' .
Howard ( the thick middle-aged man ) was looking at her .
`` And who is this '' ? ?
"He asked , when she passed him a glass ."
"`` Oh that's Linda Kay '' , Mama Albright said fondly ."
"`` Let's see '' , Cousin Ada said ."
`` He's a right smart younger than the rest '' ? ?
"`` Oh yes '' , Mama laughed ."
`` He's ten years younger than Ernest .
We didn't expect him to come along ; ;
thought for the longest he was a tumor '' .
"`` Who is Howard , anyway '' ? ?"
She asked Bobby Joe that night .
`` He makes me uncomfortable '' .
`` Oh he's a second cousin or something .
`` How old is he '' ? ?
"`` Gosh , I don't know ."
"Thirty-five , I guess ."
He's been married and got this half-grown kid .
"If he bothers you , don't pay him any mind ."
He's just a big windbag '' .
Bobby Joe was thinking about something else .
He was talking about antelope again when they woke up .
`` Who '' ? ?
When he was a kid I wasn't around '' .
"Driving along the caliche-topped road to town , Howard talked ."
"`` You lucky kids '' , he said ."
Then he told Linda Kay about himself .
It made her feel different about Howard .
`` Cook a whole antelope '' ? ?
I never even saw any '' .
"`` Oh , you could ."
Linda Kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable .
but she had never been so aware of anyone's flesh before .
to Alex they were merely six not unusual hens' eggs .
"There was little enough time to contemplate them , however ; ;"
He placed it on Alex's lap .
All search was ended ; ;
he had found his fowl .
The clocks struck seven-thirty as they approached the hotel entrance ; ;
`` Comment '' ? ?
"`` Who was that , young feller '' ? ?"
The doctor instantly asked .
"She looked mighty interested , though ."
The doctor's mind was working at a great speed ; ;
`` Have you got our keys handy '' ? ?
`` Right in my pocket '' .
Now you go outside and beckon me when it's safe '' .
The hall was empty and Alex beckoned ; ;
A guest was locking his room ; ;
they passed behind him and got to Alex's room unnoticed .
They waited three minutes and then crept out on tip-toe ; ;
"Next , the hen was nested and all seemed well ."
"You in this house '' , he always told her ."
"`` Leave me alone '' , Leona said ."
`` Can't you see I'm busy '' ? ?
She looked at him impudently over the corner of the paper .
His eye had fastened on her leg ; ;
"bending , he touched her knee ."
She twitched her leg away .
"`` Fuss , fuss , old man '' ."
She had an alley cat's manners .
Winston stacked Miss Ada's thin pink dishes in the sink .
Then he spread out the last list on the counter .
"Sighing , Leona dropped the paper and stood up ."
`` I guess I better get ready to go '' .
Winston watched her fumbling to untie her apron .
"Carefully , he undid the bow ."
`` How come your bows is always cockeyed '' ? ?
She turned and put her arms around his neck .
"`` I don't want to leave here , Winston '' ."
`` Now listen to that '' .
"He drew back , embarrassed and pleased ."
"`` At least there is room here '' , she said ."
`` I told you what Miss Ada's doctor said '' .
`` I don't mean Miss Ada ! !
What you think I care about that ? ?
I mean our children '' .
She sounded as though they already existed .
`` We've got plenty of time to think about that .
All the time in the world .
"We've only been married four years , January '' ."
`` Four years '' ! !
"`` That's a long time , waiting '' ."
"Too many times was the truth of it , Winston thought ."
He hardly believed his reason himself any more .
"He doubted whether she heard him , over the running water ."
"She was too young , that was all ; ;"
too young and thin and straight .
`` Winston '' ! !
"It was Mr. Jack , bellowing out in the hall ."
Winston hurried through the swinging door .
`` This coat looks like a rag heap '' .
There were a few blades of lint on the shoulder .
He gave Mr. Jack a real going-over ; ;
`` Hey '' ! !
Winston apologized and quickly set the hat right .
Winston enjoyed seeing him start out ; ;
he wore his clothes with style .
`` Look out for those movers '' ! !
Winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car ; ;
"a handsome , fine-looking man it made him proud to see ."
"For the first time , he be sad about the move ."
That house was ten years off his life let himself .
Winston had been surprised at her for that .
In a week the hyacinths would spike out .
and after that the Japanese cherries .
where would she go for her gardening now ? ?
Somehow Winston didn't think she'd take to window boxes .
"Sighing , he hurried to the living room ."
He had a thousand things to see to .
the snail is pulling in her horns .
She was looking out at the garden .
Winston had the big straw basket ready in the hall .
He brought it in and put it down beside her .
Miss Ada was looking fine ; ;
"Frowning , Miss Ada studied the list ."
"`` Well , let's see ."
The china lemon tree .
The alabaster cockatoo '' .
Neither of them trusted the movers .
He picked up the photograph and began to wrap it .
Winston folded the tissue paper carefully .
`` He's used it every day ; ;
"every morning , I lay out his clothes on it '' ."
"`` Well , that's over now ."
And it was his main present ! !
"Leave that fool picture out '' , she added sharply ."
Winston laid it in the basket .
`` Mr. Jack sets store by that '' .
"`` Really , Winston ."
It was meant to be my present '' .
But she went on down the list .
Winston was relieved ; ;
those presents had been on his mind .
`` Tell me what to get her for Christmas '' .
You mean picture of me '' ? ?
But Winston had persuaded him .
"On Christmas night , they had had a disagreement about it ."
Finally she had come down ; ;
`` How do you like it '' ? ?
`` Is that a compliment '' ? ?
`` I don't know '' .
"`` Lovie , you make me feel naked '' ."
"`` Not a line , not a wrinkle ."
"`` Look , an old man ."
Will you wear pink when you're sixty '' ? ?
"`` Darling , I love that photograph ."
I'm going to put it on my dresser '' .
`` I guess it's children make a woman old .
A man gets old anyhow '' .
All I want is a picture -- with a few lines .
Make the man put them in if he has to '' .
Was it love ? ?
I had no doubt that it was .
"My parents' welcoming arms would seem woeful , inadequate , unwanted ."
These letters became the center of my existence .
We would write to one another and make a definite plan .
She was terribly pleased .
"In or out , should I kiss her goodnight ? ?"
Her optimism gave me heart .
I forced confidence into myself .
"I made inquiries , I read a book of etiquette ."
I set the hour of our meeting for seven .
The night was cold but the crowd kept one warm .
His neighbors cheered him on .
There was a great sense of camaraderie .
How did one join them ? ?
Where were they all walking to ? ?
Where exactly would we go after the movie ? ?
Suppose I hadn't brought along enough money ? ?
I felt for my wallet .
"Its thick , substantial outline calmed me ."
My heart almost stopped beating .
This had worried her .
`` Why do you say that '' ? ?
I grew up in an Irish neighborhood on Chicago's West Side .
Don't tell me about drunks .
You're not the kind to go violent .
Were you in love with that girl '' ? ?
"She met my eyes , suddenly angry ."
I'm interested in every patient I've helped take care of .
"`` You what , Mary Jane '' ? ?"
I don't blame that girl for breaking her engagement with you .
Was she pretty '' ? ?
`` Why should I ? ?
I've worked this ward for three months now .
We keep getting the same ones back again and again .
"You've not seemed like them , but maybe you are ."
You've treated your stay here like a big joke .
"I wanted to go to college , too '' --"
`` Why didn't you '' ? ?
`` Chicago has some of the best '' --
Her eyes flashed angrily .
`` You don't seem to know much about reality .
I'll tell you why I didn't go to college ; ;
I'm the oldest of six children .
Nurses' training here doesn't cost anything .
They even pay me six dollars a month .
I think it's a good deal .
`` Do you have a boy friend '' ? ?
`` My aunt raised me .
Aunt Mary died when I was doing my military service .
I have no one but myself to worry about '' .
"`` I'm sorry '' , she said ."
`` I don't know what I'd do without my family .
We've always been so close '' .
`` Tell me more about them '' .
When she had finished I said :
"He's a pretty good judge of character , Anderson ."
`` What about you ? ?
"`` Yes , I'll get one overnight a month '' ."
`` Do you like to dance ? ?
They always have a good orchestra '' .
There hadn't been anything really personal in her interest in me .
It was a fantastic story .
a figment of Carl Anderson's imagination .
Such optimism was completely unjustified .
The critics literally screamed their indignation .
We opened on Friday and closed the following Monday .
"`` All right '' , I said ."
"`` I beg your pardon , sir '' ? ?"
This is Dale Nelson the actor '' .
Could you possibly have lunch with him today ? ?
"`` You'll send the Rolls-Royce , of course '' ? ?"
"`` Yes , of course , Mr. Nelson '' ."
They all bowed low as I approached them .
I walked over to him .
`` You Mr. Nelson '' ? ?
`` That's right '' .
I followed him out through the lobby to the street .
I was giving the parked cars the once-over .
I walked with him back to the entrance .
I was back in ten minutes .
You're the one I was talking to about a monthly rental .
"`` That's right '' , I told him ."
Can you find it all right '' ? ?
"`` Sure '' , I told him ."
I always keep a set in the car .
The attendant waved me on .
You want to sit down .
Your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary .
He came out alone .
`` It's a sublease .
I have a couple of them I'm figuring on ; ;
I kept trying to get him to take my money .
"`` Okay '' , I told him ."
`` I'm in a rush right now .
I know where the car is .
Want me to drive it out '' ? ?
`` It's one of the rules on transients .
Regulars drive out their own cars '' .
"`` Oh , that's all right '' , he said ."
`` You're going to be a regular .
You'll get in the office building here .
By the time I'd made it he was gone .
Traffic was pretty heavy .
I made time and picked him up within ten blocks .
After fifteen minutes of traffic driving he turned to the left .
That meant he'd parked someplace .
My quarry was in the apartment house for two hours .
Then he came out and started driving toward the beach .
By this time it was dark .
I remembered it was the Peeping Tom place .
I could have written anything .
"`` You mean you're all alone , Mr. Richards '' ? ?"
`` That's right '' .
`` I don't think so '' .
"It's a formality , you know '' ."
`` Any difference in the rate '' ? ?
"`` Not to you '' , she said smiling ."
`` It's ten dollars either way .
We like to run a nice quiet place '' .
"`` Thank you '' , I told her ."
The construction was reasonably solid ; ;
She knew where to come .
He didn't have to telephone .
"`` You really in a hurry , Handsome '' ? ?"
"`` I'm in a hurry , Beautiful '' ."
`` It's early in the evening to be in a hurry .
There's lots of time left '' .
That's when my evening commences '' .
"`` I'll be here at ten-fifty-five '' , I said ."
"`` Oh , you ! !"
`` That's what they all say .
What's that thing going buzz-buzz-buzz in your car '' ? ?
I didn't turn it off '' .
I reached over and switched off the electronic bugging device .
Then I shut off the device again .
She wanted to hang around while I was eating .
"`` No '' , I said ."
`` It's a kindness to her .
"You see , she's on a diet ."
"`` Diets can be terrible '' , the girl said ."
`` How much overweight is she '' ? ?
She looked at me provocatively .
"The thin man said , `` That-a-way '' ."
`` -- second building on the right '' .
`` -- it says police right on the door '' .
Roberta and Dave began to back toward the door .
The thin man waved the gun again .
"He said , `` Right around the corner '' ."
`` A night policeman just like in the States .
You know '' ? ?
"At the door , Dave paused to feel for the latch ."
Roberta glanced up at her husband .
She decided to risk it .
She tore open the back door .
Slowly she turned to face the men again .
Rat-face at the counter was on his feet .
She sidled along the booths one step at a time .
The gun followed her .
It was getting light .
"When he was answered , he said , `` Albert ? ?"
Got it '' ? ?
The white Buick hadn't moved away yet .
"He said , `` Grosse ? ?"
"`` I ain't kidding you , Vince ."
How could she ? ?
`` Howda I know '' ? ?
Kinda like a zombie ? ?
but he was aware of it just the same .
sugar sprayed with a hiss that was loud in the silence .
`` Why does everything have to happen to me '' ? ?
Don't you and Barney ever use your brains '' ? ?
The fat man didn't answer .
`` She don't know nothing about them cars .
She thinks she's in a ordinary garage '' .
"`` How do you know , stupid ? ?"
And put Cate's gun back '' .
`` I know '' .
Grosse tucked the gun under the counter .
`` -- one word of this gets to Guardino '' --
`` Who's telling Guardino '' ? ?
`` You get that kid over to Rose's house '' .
The fat man winced .
Grosse spread his hands .
In the tool crib she can't get away '' .
"`` Dammit all , Vince ."
I ain't no baby sitter '' .
Grosse rubbed the bridge of his nose where it was swollen .
`` You don't hafta get nasty .
I wish you luck when you try scaring that kid '' .
His voice lost its sullen tones and he chuckled .
`` I got one question '' .
`` What is it '' ? ?
Grosse ducked and sniggered .
`` Where'd you say you was born '' ? ?
`` In a Chicago slum just like you .
Lauren Landis rubbed her face against the blanket .
She had cried a little because she was frightened .
Was it because she had shown panic ? ?
Who could blame her for that ? ?
She was glad the fat man had left .
Barney was not really frightening .
She smiled at him wetly .
He placed a bottle opener on the counter .
"So , he understood her panic ."
It was icy cold and tasted delicious .
She felt a lift in spirit .
When she was finished she pushed it back .
"She called softly , `` Barney '' ."
He looked in her direction but he didn't answer .
"Lauren said , `` Why can't I call my home ? ?"
I could send the money right back '' .
Barney finished the cigarette he had been smoking .
Now he looked at her .
"He said , `` I only work here '' ."
"Lauren said , `` Please '' ? ?"
But he was back at work on a car .
She dropped her head on her arms on the counter .
Her heart was thumping painfully ; ;
Something wet and hot was trickling on her wrists .
"Her mother and father , for instance ."
Where were they now ? ?
This is the end of the line '' .
And what would her mother be doing right now ? ?
Lauren Landis was in trouble and she was alone .
"Somewhere birds were sweetly calling , were answered ."
I saw that woman's apron behind the door .
Dave made some sound meant to convey agreement .
He inserted the car key in the lock .
Roberta was violently trembling .
Why don't we drive around the corner '' ? ?
The car door crashed shut .
The engine throbbed into life .
"Dave said , `` I got the message ."
"Roberta said , `` no ."
Suppose Lauren comes looking for us ? ?
The big car sprang away from the curb like something alive .
Roberta glanced at him and stopped trembling .
His jowls were spiked by barbs of graying beard .
"His small , mean eyes regarded Marty steadily , unblinkingly ."
Marty recognized the man .
"This was Acey Squire , proprietor of the juke joint ."
Do you know where it might have gone '' ? ?
He looked straight at Marty .
He did not answer .
`` Did anyone see my cab '' ? ?
"He asked , keeping his voice casual ."
`` I see there are some cars here .
And then a startling thing occurred .
"There was no word spoken , no apparent signal given ."
Yet the men all moved at the same instant .
The station wagon and the old Plymouth headed east toward Jarrodsville .
The Ford and the pickup truck sped west toward Sanford's Run .
In seconds all four cars were out of sight .
From a great distance thunder growled and broke the silence .
Land looked back toward the dilapidated house .
He thought he saw a pale face at a window .
Perhaps it was Dora May .
Perhaps she would be glad that they hadn't hurt him .
There were other farmhouses nearby .
"There was another on this side , a little further down ."
There were many more between here and Jarrodsville .
Telephone poles lined the road .
They reared tall and mocking .
Their wires stretched out into infinity .
There was nothing he could do but walk .
There were several people on the porch of the farmhouse .
Then he realized the utter futility of the idea .
Even the eyes of the smallest children seemed malicious .
"They , too , stared at him ."
The drums of thunder were right behind him now .
A foolish thought came into his head .
He remembered a story he had read as a youth .
It was probably one of Kipling's tales of the British Army .
It concerned an officer who had been disgraced and drummed out .
Marty wished these poor farm people would turn their backs .
The fencing by the roadside ended .
The day's rain had been added to the stagnant water .
It was coming toward him .
The car was now in sight .
Marty's heart skipped a beat when he recognized it .
Acey Squire's station wagon .
It had headed back toward Jarrodsville .
Now Acey and his friends were returning to seek him out .
Then there was another sound .
It was the Ford that had been outside Burch's farm .
Marty looked helplessly in both directions .
They bore down on him .
There was nothing he could do except jump into the ditch .
"He jumped , and sank to his knees in muddy water ."
"He had turned his ankle slightly , and it pained him ."
He still had three miles to go .
He could not go through the fields .
The Admassy place could not be far now .
He did not dare climb back up to the road .
"He stood , panting , for a moment ."
He lost all sense of dignity .
He had to reach Admassy's place .
It was his only sanctuary .
The fences stretched on endlessly .
And then he heard them .
And now he saw them .
They had timed it better this time .
They would reach him at almost exactly the same instant .
They were coming on at reckless speed for such old vehicles .
They thundered at him .
He forced himself to stay frozen there .
He did not leave the middle of the road .
He did not try to run .
"He trudged on , his aching eyes focused straight ahead ."
He was nearing the Admassy house .
"He was going to make it , he told himself ."
`` Not again so soon '' .
It was the sound of a siren .
It was the prowl car from the sheriff's office .
The car drew up alongside him and stopped .
"`` Get in '' , Charley Estes said brusquely ."
There was someone in front with the sheriff .
"It was Pete Holmes , the cabdriver ."
But there wasn't no use in me staying there .
I couldn't fight a dozen or so of 'em .
Why didn't you wait at the Burch house ? ?
You must've known I'd gone to get the sheriff .
"I was lucky they let me go , I guess '' ."
This is redneck country .
Rourke was talking on the phone when he came back .
"`` About an hour , eh ? ?"
Are you positive '' ? ?
Want to try and meet him there '' ? ?
Shayne looked at his watch .
"He said with satisfaction , `` That's fine , Tim ."
I'll be there '' .
Rourke confirmed the appointment over the phone and hung up .
`` I hope to Christ .
`` Where '' ? ?
`` It's out in the Northeast section .
Have you got my car here '' ? ?
`` It's parked in front '' .
I can drop you back here to pick mine up '' .
"That is , maybe not too much of a lady ."
He opened the door and followed Rourke out .
`` I haven't the faintest idea .
Isn't this Felice's street '' ? ?
"Shayne asked , peering ahead at the partially obscured street sign ."
Not more than a block or so '' .
On the right '' .
`` It was back there .
"Shayne said , `` I know it was , Tim '' ."
His voice was chilling and cold .
`` I didn't notice it .
I was watching for numbers .
"`` It has a Beach license , Tim ."
Two men in the front seat .
A couple named Harris and Geely .
Those names mean anything to you '' ? ?
"`` Wait a minute , Mike ."
In Painter's office this evening .
`` What are they doing here '' ? ?
"`` A stake-out , I suppose ."
"I'm not positive , Tim ."
I may be wrong .
Make them show their hands .
They've got no official standing on this side of the Bay .
Shayne opened the door on his side and stepped out .
Timothy Rourke groaned dismally as he slid under the wheel .
"`` The things you talk me into , Mike ."
`` How often do they add up to headlines ? ?
You should complain '' .
Take your time with your drink .
Be excited and don't identify yourself .
I'll be waiting for you there '' .
Will that pay for a pint I can take with me .
`` We sure don't '' .
The bartender winked back at him and palmed the bill .
"Three minutes , Tim '' ."
Said they'd have a patrol car here fast .
What happened with you '' ? ?
`` They'll have fun explaining that to the Miami cops .
Got no business over here on a stake-out anyway '' .
Shayne found one marked Perrin Aj .
"Eight , nine steps above him , Roberts had paused ."
I wouldn't have to tell them I had Roberts --
"He rose stiffly , forcing his knees to lock ."
The knifelike pain in his groin nearly brought him down again .
"The pain dulled as he moved , and he steadied inside ."
"After a moment he extended one hand , the fingers curled ."
"`` Come on '' , he said ."
He held the razor well out to one side .
They were eight feet apart when Roberts cleared the last step .
Mickey waited with slack arms .
"`` Any time , Roberts '' , he said ."
The taunt was lost on Roberts .
He was just short of arm's reach when he stopped .
"Mickey backed off again and Roberts hesitated , then came along ."
"The kick came , sudden and vicious but short ."
Roberts sagged and slashed at him wildly .
They were in the center of the lobby now .
When he charged Mickey was ready .
He couldn't feel any .
Roberts appeared to be dead ; ;
"if not yet , then soon , very soon ."
Suddenly it was cold in the lobby .
They would have to .
By then they could never catch up with the others .
There's no other way ; ;
I'll have to do it myself .
He looked at where Roberts lay sprawled on the step .
Mickey was sure now he was dead .
"One thing , he thought , nobody knows about it yet ."
He left a few things .
It didn't have to be perfect .
Roberts was a wastrel .
It took him nearly an hour .
He was mildly surprised to find it was snowing .
He could feel it on his face and in his hair .
Then he backed out and swung around to the front drive .
He put it in his own pocket for safekeeping .
Then he went back for Roberts .
The body was heavier than he had anticipated .
"It snowed continuously , but quietly , evenly ."
It wasn't like carrying the suitcase .
The soft snow was deceitful underfoot .
Twice he nearly fell .
There was too much weight casually to toss it away .
It would be a bad place to die .
It was too late to worry about that .
It was a relief to get rid of the weight .
It hung momentarily on the point of dropping off .
"Deep enough , he decided ."
By spring it would be a skeleton .
He made his way back to the Jeep .
He put in a call to Cunningham from his hotel room .
The maid answered and he decided Nancy must be at work .
A woman named Lisa who tells nobody anything about herself .
That courtyard picture with the same initials '' .
`` I'm not exactly jumping up and down with enthusiasm .
I'll call you in a day or so '' .
He checked into a motel and drove downtown .
The courthouse was a white-stucco building minus the customary dome .
He figured his best bet was a call on the sheriff .
The sheriff's swivel chair tilted back .
Pity we don't know more about him .
`` That's an idea .
Mrs. Calhoun has been society editor here for twenty-five years .
She'd also remember if the groom died later '' .
`` Last year ? ?
"Well , I do remember one ."
Married a man named Vincent Black .
First bride like that I've seen in twenty-five years '' .
`` What reason did she give '' ? ?
`` Was her name Lisa Carmody '' ? ?
I can look it up .
Do they still live here '' ? ?
`` I think they moved away shortly after they were married .
I'm sure it'll be in the files .
We usually run a social note when somebody moves away '' .
He stood up and thanked her .
`` Have they inherited some money or something '' ? ?
She asked with a reportorial gleam in her eye .
"Mr. Ferrell is a private detective , Hirey ."
"`` Sure '' , said Hirey ."
`` I'll just leave the door open .
He pulled it open .
`` Now don't shut this door .
It won't open from inside .
Hirey treats himself a lot better than we do prisoners .
A metal table and four chairs stood in the center .
Hank thanked them and promised to observe the rules .
"It was , indeed , all here -- almost a century ."
From reconstruction to moon rockets .
He staggered over and dropped it on the table .
No mention of New Orleans .
Hank was beginning to feel sharp concern for Mr. Black .
Now for their exodus from Gulf Springs .
The air conditioner was no longer running .
It clanged shut as he sprang toward it .
He pressed his face against the grille .
`` Who's there '' ? ?
Then he heard the outer door closing .
"`` Hey , come back '' , he shouted ."
Then the faint beginnings of fear stirred in his mind .
To search his room at the motel ? ?
"No , they could kill him just as easy right now ."
Nobody could hear what was going on in this underground vault .
`` Well '' -- said Mr. Skyros .
`` I take a little time to think it over '' .
It was awkward : very awkward .
And Angie would hear about it .
the genial smile seemed painted on his face .
Angie knew -- Speak of dangerous information ! !
Angie knew too much entirely already .
Really he had Mr. Skyros at bay
`` Big favor I done you .
"And can't say I blame you '' , said Angie thoughtfully ."
`` This deal with the ace o' spades .
"All about that Angie knew , too ."
he found money much more interesting ; ;
I stay in business so long because I'm careful .
"`` That's a long while '' , said Angie ."
I go over to Castro and get fixed up there .
I can't wait no two weeks '' .
Angelo gave him an affectionate smile .
And all because of Domokous ! !
"Of course , there was another factor ."
"Who knew , Angie might not last long ."
He patted Angelo's thin shoulder paternally .
"You don't need worry , Angelo ."
"It's awkward , you see that , isn't it '' ? ?"
"`` I appreciate it , you do that ."
We don't none of us want no trouble .
Or maybe I call you -- tonight ? ?
"`` Sure '' , said Angie ."
"`` Sure , Mr. Skyros ."
"Fifty a throw , that the deal ? ?"
"`` Standard deal , Mr. Skyros ."
You go 'n' have a look round for it '' .
But I do my best for you '' .
It could all be straightened out later .
After this deal with the Bouvardier woman went through .
An ace of spades .
"Funny how seldom they did : used to it , probably ."
The kind who came into a cheap store like this ! !
"Grab , snatch , I saw that first ! !"
"Off at noon , and she'd never come back ."
"Money -- a lot of money , enough ."
Not when she'd waited so long already .
No need say anything at all to the old woman .
"She had it all planned out , how she'd do ."
It wasn't as if she wanted much .
"Prettier , she'd do her hair another way ; ;"
`` Think I can't count '' ? ?
Katya made up the amount in indifferent silence .
"She was listening to other voices , out of the future ."
"Some of those vaguely-imagined new , different people ."
"Soon , very soon now"
Mendoza didn't wake until nearly nine-thirty .
It was going to be another hot day ; ;
already the thermometer stood close to ninety .
Alison was still sound asleep ; ;
Surely she was just a trifle fatter around the middle ? ?
`` Y que sigue despues ? ?
-- What then '' ? ?
He asked her severely .
I wonder if the Carters would take one .
Maude's long nose unexpectedly wrinkled up .
`` Happened to be in the hall ! !
Happened to hear you quarrel about her ! !
"Oh , well , you can't really blame Lolotte ."
She lost her beau to you '' .
Sarah remembered it clearly .
`` I've got to get busy .
"Miss Celie's taken to her bed , with the door locked ."
Drink your coffee '' --
`` It's -- cold '' .
Maude suddenly looked quite capable of pouring it down her throat .
"`` I don't want it '' , Sarah said , firmly ."
Ben and Lucien have gone after them .
`` I don't know Mrs. Stowe .
What can they do if they find them '' ? ?
`` They can't do anything .
"It's silly , childish , running after them like that ."
I told Ben so .
Or someone had taken it during her first day at Honotassa .
He didn't even know that she was there .
Then somebody else ? ?
"Don't question , Rev had said , don't invite danger ."
That was not reasonable either .
That made a certain amount of logic .
It was merely an attempt to frighten her .
She wouldn't go back to New York as Maude suggested ; ;
she wouldn't run like a scared cat .
"But -- well , she'd be very careful ."
Rev had known all along .
He could conceivably have wished to make sure ; ;
Rev had stressed the need for money .
Rev would never have tried to give her poison ! !
She thrust the envelope back in the bag ; ;
Sarah swallowed past another kind of constriction in her throat .
"`` Well , then who brought it '' ? ?"
Glendora put down a dish of lukewarm rice .
`` Not much breakfast this morning .
In the kitchen Glendora was despairingly picking chickens .
"`` Get a basket '' , Sarah told her ."
`` We'll go to the storehouse '' .
Sarah found the right key and unlocked the door .
It was dark but dry and cool .
"They wouldn't go hungry , not yet ."
And the fields were green and growing .
She couldn't see how her death could affect Maude .
Yet Maude had suggested that Sarah return to New York .
"Rev , George and Lolotte were mending shoes ."
They were all three bent over a shabby riding boot ; ;
George had a tack hammer .
"`` With boots on '' , Lolotte laughed softly ."
Rev looked up and saw her .
Lolotte looked up and stiffened .
George didn't look up at all .
"Rev said , `` Come in , Sarah ."
Reckon you know the news '' .
Rev's face was suddenly a little fixed and questioning .
He turned to George and Lolotte .
`` Take your cobbler's shop somewhere else .
I want to talk to Sarah '' .
A rush of panic caught Sarah .
I mean I've got to -- to see to the kitchen .
Now why did I do that ? ?
"She thought as warm , drizzling rain touched her face ."
"She was no schoolgirl , refusing to bear tales ."
As she reached the kitchen door the answer presented itself ; ;
So she couldn't choose Rev as a confidant ; ;
it must be Lucien .
Glendora gave a gulp .
"`` Miss Sarah , I can't cut up no chicken ."
Miss Maude say she won't '' .
`` Not since last night .
I didn't think there was any reason to '' .
`` Maybe there isn't .
Speak to him again anyway .
You might try looking into his wife too .
`` You think Black's the one we're looking for '' ? ?
"I think he might be '' , Conrad said grimly ."
`` Then again he might not '' .
"`` What a stinking world '' , Rourke said ."
`` Black is Gilborn's best friend '' .
`` I know '' .
`` Will you be coming back soon '' ? ?
`` I think so .
I'm on my way to see the Jacobs woman '' .
`` Gilborn's secretary ? ?
You don't think Gilborn is the -- '' ? ?
`` I don't think anything .
I'd like to make sure .
I'll see you later '' .
`` Aren't you ever going to go home '' ? ?
He looked at his watch .
It was ten minutes before eleven .
But he still wanted to know why .
"After leaving Conrad , Gilborn had no destination ."
"As he walked , he tried to think ."
Mainly of what Conrad had tried to make him believe .
There was nothing coherent about his thinking .
Conrad's words had intellectual meaning for him only .
"Emotionally , they penetrated him not at all ."
Whoever he was and your wife were intimate .
Gilborn remembered Conrad's exact words .
They made sense and yet they didn't .
He knew Conrad had told him the truth .
Yet it wasn't so .
It wasn't so because it couldn't be so .
Kitti had come along to justify everything .
"She was his goal , she was his reason ."
He had lived all his life waiting for her .
He could not consider it now .
"And so he walked , aimless again ."
He looked at Gilborn with undisguised curiosity .
Gilborn passed by him without seeing him .
"In the apartment itself , all was still ."
The police were no longer there .
Except that Kitti wasn't there .
Someone had taken her away from him .
"Where there is a victim , there is a killer ."
Whoever he was and your wife were intimate .
"He rose from the chair , took off his coat ."
"Quickly , he went into the bedroom ."
The bed still showed signs of where Kitti had lain .
Gilborn stood there for a long time .
He looked at the bed unblinkingly .
The bed was empty now .
Kitti would lie in it no more .
He would lie in it no more .
"For thirty minutes , Stanley Gilborn stood there ."
He could think of no answer .
Gilborn put on his coat again .
He knew he would never see it again .
She wondered whether Stanley would call .
Why hadn't he called ? ?
Stanley really was quite predictable .
That was one of the things she liked about Stanley .
He wasn't like so many other men .
"The dentist last night , for instance ."
Dinner and the movies had been fine .
He had taken her upstairs to say good night .
She had invited him in for coffee .
But he hadn't understood .
Stanley wasn't like that .
Except for that one morning .
She thought she was going to die .
Blanche couldn't remember when she had first arrived at this conclusion .
She was thirty-one years old then .
Her mother was already considerably concerned over her daughter's future .
"As a result , he never looked for it ."
"Unquestionably , Blanche loved Stanley ."
"And then , unexpectedly , Stanley made his announcement ."
Kitti could have married a score of men .
He hadn't come back for over two .
It was too unprecedented .
She stayed away for ten days .
Those ten days were like no others that Blanche had known .
"Mostly , she stayed in bed ."
"`` Right '' , said the fingerprint man ."
"He was moving like a ballet dancer , playing for laughs ."
"This , you will remember , was still New Year's Day ."
Felix was the exception .
Just put yourself in Felix's place for a moment .
"You're a taxpayer , householder , landlord ."
You find your house a focus of public and police attention .
Maybe one could be startled into forgetfulness .
You identify yourself and ask him what's going on .
"`` Got the upstairs guy '' , he bellows ."
Do I send him up '' ? ?
Then he turns back to you .
"`` Go on in '' , he says ."
`` They'll tell you what's cooking '' .
He came bounding up the stairs and joined the dance .
Our man stopped dead and glowered at Felix .
This was a bull of a man .
"He was big-chested , big-shouldered and heavy-armed ."
It was almost as white as his teeth .
For a man of his mass he was curiously short .
The man was just this side of being a freak .
His eyes were clear .
Not even a whiff .
`` Felix '' ? ?
"`` Me '' , he said merrily ."
"`` Me , the happy one '' ."
"`` That much Latin we remember '' , Gibby said dryly ."
"`` I try '' , Felix said blithely ."
I've never noticed that it improves things any '' .
"`` Bully for you '' , Gibby said ."
`` What's the rest of your name '' ? ?
`` No rest of it .
Felix is all there is '' .
`` All there ever was '' ? ?
`` You live in the present '' ? ?
"`` In the present '' , Felix proclaimed ."
`` For the future .
"`` We '' , Gibby announced , `` are not philosophers ."
We are Assistant District Attorneys .
This gentleman is a police officer .
He is a fingerprint specialist .
The happy one could never have looked happier .
This was more than joy .
"`` Those lovely whorls '' , he chortled ."
"`` So intricate , so beautiful ."
I love fingerprints '' .
Gibby called him back .
"`` Past , yes , but important ."
`` That important '' ? ?
`` That important '' .
"`` Grubb '' , Felix whispered ."
`` Felix Grubb '' ? ?
"Gibby asked , not bothering to whisper ."
"`` Shh '' , Felix implored ."
Obligingly Gibby lowered his voice .
`` Felix Grubb '' ? ?
"Edmund , but not for years ."
For years it's been just Felix .
That was almost forty years ago '' .
We followed him up the stairs .
Felix took us into his studio .
None of his movements was tentative .
There was no process of trial and error .
They were all completely shrouded .
The equipment was solid and heavy and in good condition .
There were tools about but they were neatly kept .
There was no confusion and no litter .
Supplies of sheet metal were neatly stacked in bins .
Andy did not see the newspapers the next day .
Outside his window bloomed a beautiful summer day .
Hub was sitting in a chair that blocked the hall door .
"He was dozing , perhaps the only sleep he'd gotten ."
He snapped to alertness at Andy's entrance .
"`` Sorry , Mr. Paxton ."
"Lot of people waiting to see you , though '' ."
`` Reporters '' ? ?
`` Our own people .
Questions about the show tonight '' .
Hub picked up the telephone .
`` Shall I let them know you're awake '' ? ?
"How's Lissa , do you know '' ? ?"
"She's got plenty of guts , Mr. Paxton ."
You want me to call her '' ? ?
`` She expecting me to '' ? ?
Hub shook his head so Andy told him not to bother .
He could not manage the former or expect the latter ; ;
they had nothing to give to each other .
"He had little time to himself , anyway ."
Thornburg arrived with the writers .
He asked if there was anything he could do .
"But from Rocco Vecchio , they heard nothing ."
At last it was time to depart .
El Dorado was surrounded by a mob .
"They overflowed the parking lot , making progress by automobile difficult ."
Word of his arrival spread through the crowd like a brushfire .
"They surged around him , fingers pointing , eyes prying ."
They had come not to admire but to observe .
"`` It's worse inside '' , Thornburg informed Andy ."
`` Skolman's jammed in every table he could find .
Backstage was tomblike by contrast .
"Andy's co-workers kept their distance , awed by the tragedy ."
It was signed by everyone in the troupe .
Andy couldn't help but be touched .
Andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment .
Bake himself looked better ; ;
any kind of job was better than brooding .
I wouldn't want him to miss the message '' .
Skolman wasn't the only one who didn't care for Andy's scheme .
Andy rolled up the revised script he had been studying .
`` What about them '' ? ?
`` They're going to louse me up good .
`` I want you to have the speakers taken out '' .
"`` Sure , I know ."
But it's such a long shot '' --
`` No longer than yours .
"What do you expect to get tonight , anyway ? ?"
Andy crumbled the script in his fist .
"But don't try to stop me , either '' ."
I can hardly wait '' .
"But Bonner departed , still full of ill will ."
"he had to cling to routine , tested procedures ."
To act otherwise would be to admit his helplessness .
"But , admit or not , Bonner was helpless ."
Andy's performance was scheduled for eleven o'clock .
You about ready '' ? ?
`` What's he complaining about '' ? ?
"`` They're drinking , aren't they '' ? ?"
We got a bunch of sippers out there tonight .
I guess nobody wants to pass out and miss anything '' .
"Hub , you stick by the stage door ."
There's a couple of call-backs I can work on '' .
`` You're a sweetheart -- but leave one line open .
He may try to phone us '' .
Here's where luck would normally step in .
But this was no ordinary show and Andy knew it .
The audience had come not to be entertained but to judge .
Twenty-four hours had changed him from a performer to a freak .
"Within this framework , what followed was strained , even macabre ."
Their clapping grew more fervent ; ;
The worst was yet to come .
Vecchio was nodding and pointing at the large suitcase he held .
Andy felt his heart thud heavily with relief .
He waved at Fox to cut off the finale introduction .
The music died away discordantly .
He drew a deep breath .
Nor could he blame them .
`` Lullaby and goodnight .
He wondered if the audience would let him finish .
"though contemptuous , they were still polite ."
Someone clapped tentatively then quickly stopped .
"Otherwise , the silence was complete ."
Hub was there to support him .
"`` It's okay , Mr. Paxton ."
"The money's here , all of it '' ."
`` Did you hear them ? ?
Do you know what they think of me '' ? ?
`` Who needs them '' ? ?
Thornburg patted his arm .
"`` Sure , Andy , it'll be all right ."
Nothing broken that can't be mended '' .
The words were hollow .
All the king's horses and all the king's men
"`` I got it , Andy ."
You'll never believe the places I've been today .
"`` It doesn't matter , Rock ."
We've done our part '' .
The usual congratulatory crowd was conspicuously absent ; ;
the place had the air of a morgue .
"Dad , wait '' ."
He caught up with the old man in the living room .
"`` Just this one favor , Dad ."
Just don't tell Ferguson that crazy opinion of yours '' .
`` Why not '' ? ?
The old man gave the room a stare in leaving ; ;
`` It's the truth '' .
`` The Bartlett girl was killed by Mr. Dronk's son .
Why won't you accept facts ? ?
His father looked him over closely .
`` You sound like an old woman .
"`` Now , see here '' --"
Mrs. Holden turned from the window draperies .
"`` They took it away , overalls or something '' ."
She stood frowning and chewing her lip .
`` I think you had better come home '' .
"`` Mae , we're so busy ."
`` I don't care .
I want you here .
His voice grew high and trembling .
They'll they'll think I did something '' .
He couldn't see the grin that split her mouth ; ;
the teeth that shone into the phone were like a shark's .
`` You'll just have to risk it .
"You can't wander along in the dark , can you ? ?"
"They found some clothes '' , she tossed in ."
`` What '' ? ?
"Deliberately , she ignored the yelp ."
"`` Also , that Mr. Ferguson was here ."
I guess he wants to ask you some questions .
I stalled him off .
He doesn't expect you until five '' .
`` Then I'd better wait until five '' .
Come home right away '' .
She slapped the receiver into its holder and stepped away .
Her eyes were bright with anticipation .
"In his office , Mr. Holden replaced the phone slowly ."
He rose from his chair .
He had to cough then ; ;
He got his hat out of the closet .
He got into the car .
What did she think he could do ? ?
her motives were too blatant .
She wanted him to get into trouble .
"She wanted the police to notice him , suspect him ."
"Nothing bald , open ; ;"
They'd have some suspicions to repeat to the police .
It hadn't amounted to anything .
There had been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions .
Suppose the cops somehow got hold of that ? ?
He hadn't touched her .
"Too monstrous , of course ."
Mae wouldn't have plotted a thing like that .
It was just that little accidents played into her hands .
He felt light-headed and sick .
Mae was his wife .
She was married to him for better or for worse .
She wouldn't be wilfully planning his destruction .
But he couldn't imagine where .
"At the gate he slowed , looking around ."
he didn't even look up .
Holden stepped on the gas .
A new idea drifted in from nowhere .
He could go to the police .
He could throw himself on the mercy of the Police Department .
"It wasn't what Mae would want him to do , though ."
He was sure of this .
It would be such a relief .
"Sure , they're giving up hope ."
Hand in hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension .
Holden waved a hand at the empty street .
Glad to see you go .
He looked up and down the street .
Mae entered the room from the hallway to the kitchen .
And then you wiped up some grease '' .
What do you '' --
"`` I've been looking for them , and they're gone ."
The police have them now '' .
`` I don't remember any overalls at all '' .
`` They were all faded .
Worn through at the knees '' .
She stood sipping and chewing and watching .
"`` Green paint , wasn't it ? ?"
"Well , I'm not sure of the color ."
But you had them '' .
"`` Mae , sit down ."
Put down the cup of coffee .
Tell me what this is all about '' .
She shook her head .
She took another bite of toast .
"`` My goodness , you ought to remember if I do ."
Tell them the truth or something before they come here '' .
A seeping coldness entered Holden's being ; ;
`` I've never owned any painting overalls .
Or are the eyebrows more like this '' ? ?
"Different about the mouth , huh ? ?"
"More like this , maybe '' ? ?"
But Gardner Willings was not included ; ;
he had been at the Dumont for almost a week .
"With names and addresses listed , verification came next ."
It would take time ; ;
"it would , almost inevitably , trouble some water ."
Of course he's in '' -- )
The King Arthur was less expensive than the Dumont .
Check the overnighters out .
"There were other roofs , less convenient but not impossible ."
"It is dull business , detecting , and hard on feet ."
Anybody carrying anything that might hide a rifle ? ?
Long thin suitcase ? ?
"Or long fat suitcase , for that matter ? ?"
"Shrugs met that , from room clerks , from bellhops ."
"But nothing , it appeared , long enough to attract attention ."
"Cases , say , for musical instruments ? ?"
None noted at the Dumont .
Several at the King Arthur .
A combo was staying there .
And had been for a week .
Anything at all ? ?
Traces of oil on green tissue ? ?
The lab to check .
The lab : sorry .
Anything at all strange ? ?
"The house was modern , large , on five acres ."
Must have cost plenty .
The State cops would check from time to time ; ;
pass word when there was word to pass .
Weigand tossed this news into the centrifuge .
Sort out the next move .
Try to forget motive for the moment .
"Hathaway , Jerry's publicity director ; ;"
"Livingston Birdwood , producer of Uprising ."
He had left after the scuffle ; ;
had been seen to leave .
"Consider him seriously , therefore ? ?"
"Intangibles entered , then -- hunches which felt like facts ."
"Willings would ambush , certainly ; ;"
"Willings was , presumably , a better than average shot ."
To be checked out further .
"No , motive is a part of fact ."
Nobody in his right mind punishes a quarter-century-old dereliction .
Grudges simply do not keep that well in a sane mind .
Faith Constable had accomplished much in a quarter of a century .
Jeopardize it now to correct so old a wrong ? ?
Bill shook his head .
"She had left the party early , pleading a headache ."
"No lack of opportunity , presuming she had a gun ."
( Check on the Payne luggage .
) She might now have taken it away again .
Motive -- her husband wandering ? ?
"Bitter , unreasoning jealousy ? ?"
( Call it mentally young ; ;
) There was nothing to indicate that Lauren Payne was primitive .
She did not move in primitive circles .
"She was young , but not that young ."
He reminded himself that all eliminations were tentative .
"With the boy , particularly ."
Bill picked up the telephone ; ;
`` Right '' ? ?
Which probably would turn out to be true ; ;
which he obviously had to be given the opportunity to say .
He might deny the latter ; ;
He would have to be given the opportunity .
It was evident that Mullins was the man to go .
Let Mullins keep the firm seat ; ;
"Of four dark brown ears , one twitched slightly at this ."
"`` All right '' , Pam said ."
`` I know it isn't dinnertime '' .
"Shadow looked surprised , wailed , and trotted after her ."
"It was not , whatever tale was told by tails ."
Martha presumably would cope .
She might be firm .
It was most unlikely that she would be firm .
And possessed himself -- how ? ?
-- of a rifle and killed ? ?
Pam found she had no answers ; ;
had only a hope .
"The poor kid -- the poor , frail kid ."
"The poor , unlucky --"
At four o'clock in the afternoon .
Two martinis for lunch -- that was the trouble .
I ought to remember .
You just -- `` Hello ? ?
"Yes , this is she ? ?"
The voice had music in it .
"`` I said I would '' , Pam said ."
`` They won't talk about who gave the information .
Not unless they have to .
"They don't , Mrs. Constable ."
Not unless they have '' --
"`` Through a door conveniently unlocked '' , Madden supplemented ."
`` A gift horse to be viewed with suspicion '' .
Madden's dark face wore a meditative look .
Much better to break a cellar window '' .
And a pane of glass isn't hard to '' --
The telephone interrupted him .
I was hoping I'd hear from you today '' .
"`` Coroner '' , he said to Madden ."
Pauling looked at his notes .
`` Many minute hemorrhages in the lungs ; ;
particles of lint and thread in the mouth and nostrils .
No other cause of death apparent .
Trachea clear of mucus and foreign objects .
"Brain examined for thrombosis , clot or hemorrhage ."
`` That's about it .
"Oh , the time of death ."
"`` So there it is '' , he said ."
They discussed this possibility .
"Arthur Williams had to be located , they agreed ."
This was Madden's suggestion ; ;
the police chief shook his head over it .
He inferred that Hohlbein and Garth were high-priced lawyers .
He had lunch with Pauling .
He asked to see a copy of Mrs. Meeker's will .
Garth brought one out .
"`` Fairly recent '' , he remarked ."
Her estate had grown considerably .
particularly the scholarship fund .
"Most of them this past year , I'd say ."
"She'd have consulted us , you see ."
"The inspector nodded , doubting this ."
With her sharp tongue she'd have cut his pompousness to ribbons .
It would have been Hohlbein who handled her affairs .
Madden settled back to read the will .
Very nice for him .
"to Brian Thayer , the sum of ten thousand dollars ; ;"
"to the Pecks , ten thousand each ; ;"
Mrs. Meeker hadn't got around to taking care of that .
"Too bad , Madden thought ."
Joan Sheldon had earned the larger bequest .
"Mr. Hohlbein was left twenty thousand , Garth ten ."
There were no other names Madden recognized .
"Arthur Williams's might well have been included , he felt ."
`` Old people have their idiosyncrasies '' .
There was no telling how she'd react to spending money '' .
Madden inquired next about the audit of the scholarship fund .
"There was an annual audit , Garth informed him ."
No discrepancies or shortages had ever been found .
Brian Thayer was a thoroughly honest and competent administrator .
His salary had reached the ten thousand mark .
His expenses ran another four or five thousand .
Garth's glance began to flicker to his watch .
He would offer no theory to account for her murder .
The inspector knew as he left that this was wishful thinking .
Brian Thayer had a downtown address .
He took Madden into the room he used as an office .
A newspaper open at stock-market reports lay on one of them .
Thayer folded it up and offered a drink .
Thayer shook his head .
"`` It's all I think about , too ."
That and her death .
It's still unbelievable that it was murder .
"Hoag said , `` I didn't send for you , Leigh ."
I want the captain in charge .
Where is he '' ? ?
The undersecretary's in there .
"I told you there's nothing between Midge and me , nothing ."
It's all in your mind '' .
"`` Leigh , get a grip on yourself ."
It's not about you or Midge .
Griffith looked at him suspiciously through red-rimmed eyes .
`` Not about me ? ?
"You mean it , Phil ? ?"
"You wouldn't pull my leg , old man ? ?"
I did get you on the platform this morning '' .
`` I'm not pulling your leg .
Will you call that captain '' ? ?
"`` No use , he won't come '' ."
He peered closely at Hoag in the gathering darkness .
`` What happened to your head '' ? ?
`` I was hit -- knocked out .
Now will you get him '' ? ?
`` He says I'm to take the message '' .
He stared at Hoag drunkenly .
`` Who'd hit you in the head '' ? ?
`` It doesn't matter .
"Griffith said , `` That's impossible ."
Mahzeer's the ambassador '' .
`` Nevertheless it's true '' .
`` I'll show you how wrong you are .
`` So that proves it '' ! !
`` Where are they '' ? ?
"`` Where'd you expect , the john ? ?"
`` Where is that '' ? ?
"`` Facing us , two flights up ."
"Look , old man , you can't go up ."
They won't even let you in the front door .
So why don't you be a good boy and '' --
Hoag grabbed him by the shoulders .
"`` Listen to me , Leigh ."
He bit out the words .
`` And you know I can do it '' .
Griffith raised placating hands .
"`` Easy does it , Phil ."
I was just going .
I'm on my way '' .
He finished his champagne and climbed uncertainly to the next landing .
At the top a uniformed officer blocked further progress .
"`` Yes , what is it '' ? ?"
`` I want Captain Docherty '' .
They walked toward each other .
`` Well '' ? ?
Griffith looked half-crocked to the captain ; ;
it would be just like him .
`` Why not '' ? ?
Docherty went taut : was it possible ? ?
"Not possible , he thought ; ;"
"Still , this had to be checked out ."
`` Where'd your friend Hoag get his information '' ? ?
"`` Haven't the faintest , Captain '' ."
`` Would you mind sending him up here ? ?
I'd like to talk to him '' .
He would have to do something on his own .
These were the early departures ; ;
in half an hour the reception would be over .
the scene looked like a Christmas card .
This would be Mahzeer's office .
The single shot would come ; ;
Hoag would carry its sound to his grave .
"Mahzeer , of course , would be desolate ."
Where across the street ? ?
Where was Muller waiting with the rifle ? ?
Most of them could be eliminated ; ;
The legation was generously set back from the building line ; ;
Would the shot come from a roof ? ?
He ran his eye along the roof copings ; ;
almost at once a figure bulked up .
If only the latter were true .
two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted .
He quickly closed it again .
there were six apartments .
The names on the mailboxes meant nothing to him .
He peered in the boxes themselves ; ;
Had Muller made the same deduction ? ?
Muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes .
He opened the inner door ; ;
fresh scars showed that the door had been prized open .
What was he to do now ? ?
He had thought no further than finding Muller .
He could not break in on an armed man .
Was there time ? ?
his face wore a look of outrage .
He was dead before his body made contact with the floor .
`` Where's the Lieut '' ? ?
The clerk wagged his head toward the captain's office .
"Leave me alone , Gun thought ."
"Fight with Sam Schaeffer , fight with the whole damned Bureau ."
But leave me alone .
"`` No , sir '' ."
"`` Running in , running out ."
Makes for confusion and congestion '' .
Roll was being called .
Gun cleared his throat .
"`` No , sir '' ."
"`` Sergeant Vaughn , sir '' ."
"`` Now , now , you're just guessing , Sergeant '' ."
"He smiled thinly , savoring his joke ."
He must have '' --
"Now that's not regulation , is it '' ? ?"
"`` No , sir '' ."
Killpath leaned forward ; ;
But stupidity was no consolation when it had rank .
"`` I was out in the district , sir '' ."
"`` Oh , yes ."
So I have heard '' .
A car pulled into the driveway outside the window .
"What have you to say to that , Sergeant '' ? ?"
`` Well '' ? ?
Killpath licked his lips .
`` Patrolman Accacia is an alert and conscientious law-enforcement officer .
"I don't think his diligence mitigates your negligence , Matson '' ."
"Gun stiffened , his hands balling into fists at his sides ."
He clamped his jaws to keep the fury from spilling out .
"`` Morning , Lieutenant Rinker '' ."
"`` Sorry , Orville ."
I thought you hadn't come in yet '' .
`` I've been here for some time '' .
"He stood up , cocked his head and eyed Gun coldly ."
`` The sergeant is just leaving '' .
He just didn't want to talk about it .
Sol Phillips had purchased the Alliance Furniture Mart seventeen years ago .
Language was no problem anyway ; ;
`` I put her in lamps .
That way I don't lose so much '' .
`` Why don't you just hire somebody else '' ? ?
`` She says she has to finish a story '' .
`` Where did you pick him up '' ? ?
"`` Oh , I've known him quite a while '' ."
She glanced at her companion fondly .
"`` Haven't I , George '' ? ?"
`` Can I tell you a secret ? ?
We're going to get married .
Do you approve '' ? ?
She made a face at him and then she laughed .
`` Of course not '' .
"`` Stop by any time , Casey '' ."
He stood up and touched the girl's arm .
"`` Come on , darling ."
Look in the wastebasket .
It no longer mattered that Burton had outsmarted him .
And that gun was empty .
"He said : `` The crazy fool '' , half aloud ."
How can I find him ? ?
"`` Yeah '' , he said ."
`` Casey '' ? ?
`` Tony Calenda '' .
`` What picture '' ? ?
`` Who says so '' ? ?
`` One of my boys '' .
Casey believed that much .
`` So '' ? ?
`` Who says it's going to be published '' ? ?
`` I wouldn't even want it to get around '' .
"`` Look '' , he said ."
`` I was hired to take a picture .
`` You tell him '' .
"`` But I meant what I said , Casey ."
"`` You do that '' , Casey said ."
He had done all he could and that was that .
He should have stayed here and watched Burton .
So he made a mistake .
Only then did he decide he didn't want one .
You don't know me but I know you .
If you hurry you might beat the headquarters boys '' .
For over the years he had received many such calls .
Some of them came from people who identified themselves .
Others because they expected some sort of reward for the information .
`` We're out just a little too far .
`` Now '' ? ?
"`` Pretty quick '' , she replied ."
`` Will you drop the anchor '' ? ?
"Poet came up from below , wearing new bathing trunks ."
"Nobody , he suddenly realized , was saying anything ."
It seemed as if they were all under a spell .
No one had screamed .
No one had prayed .
The pilot had been good .
a tension similar to the one now .
But in the plane there was a concrete reason for it .
Poet whistled softly as he looked at the gun .
`` Hydraulic '' ? ?
`` They are the best '' .
She kicked the locker lid shut and replaced the cushion .
`` They are the most efficient '' .
`` Why do you need an arsenal '' ? ?
"Nick asked , apprehensively , staring at the weapon ."
Alfredo certainly must have enjoyed being alone .
Yet Alfredo wanted money wanted money to roam through the deserts .
But Graham hadn't stumbled on it .
The fisherman was right in the middle of the Deep .
"Meanwhile , fishermen took advantage of them to pull up whoppers ."
`` Any luck '' ? ?
`` Any news '' ? ?
`` Not a thing '' .
`` Cigarette '' ? ?
`` Kee-reist '' ! !
Nick's body became rigid .
Turning slowly he saw Poet in a brilliant glare of horror .
Poet a murderer ? ?
The sudden silence was too silent .
She had caught the implication of the oath .
`` Do you need a bandage '' ? ?
Poet rubbed his arm .
`` I'll get some ointment '' .
Elaine turned and started toward the companionway .
But the murderer to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage .
But Nick would not let go .
The air hose was free ! !
The discovery struck Nick like a blow .
Poet was not fighting Nick now .
Chief Bob Moore looked his same hick-self ; ;
a man mountain running to lard in his middle-age .
Hardly expected the head of County Homicide up for this murder .
"You sure climbed fast , Jed ."
Rookie investigator last summer and now it's Inspector Jed .
Proves a college education pays off '' .
"When I say move , a guy moves '' ! !"
"`` Don't worry about my being tough , Moore ."
Who was the murdered woman Mrs. Buck '' ? ?
"`` Widow , nice sort of woman ."
Ran a fair-sized farm .
"`` Okay , what happened '' ? ?"
"Anyway , Julia asks me to ."
`` Julia '' ? ?
"`` Come on , Inspector , look alive ."
`` Julia asks me to come out at once .
I would have come sooner if I'd known .
Don't know why the County had to send anybody up here .
Told them I can handle this '' .
`` I'll collar Tim before night '' .
`` Who's your witness '' ? ?
Probably the last of the original Island Indians .
And then rushed out of the house .
Then she heard Julia phone me .
There's no doubt this Tim sneaked back and killed Mrs. Buck .
Another fact : Tim's disappeared -- on the run .
`` Let's see it '' .
"The corpse was on a table , covered by a sheet ."
Powerful hands had killed her .
`` Find any prints '' ? ?
"I dropped the sheet , glanced at my watch ."
It was almost one and I hadn't had lunch .
She was also stone deaf in her right ear .
She calmly repeated what Moore had told me .
I do the living room last .
Miss Julia was a hard woman with a dollar .
`` Did you hear Tim return '' ? ?
Nobody came until Chief Moore '' .
I drummed on the kitchen table with my pencil .
`` Mrs. Buck have any men friends '' ? ?
`` Her '' ? ?
`` I never see none .
But then I wasn't her social secretary '' .
`` Didn't have no family -- around here .
They had a son -- killed in the war '' .
I walked into the living room .
There didn't seem to be any signs of a struggle .
`` I'll take you there .
"Okay , come on '' ."
Mrs. Williams was both sullen and frightened .
She hadn't seen him since .
`` Did Mrs. Buck owe him any wages '' ? ?
"Tim is a good man , hard working ."
He strong as a bull but gentle as a baby .
"Even if he angry , Tim wouldn't hurt a woman ."
`` Does your husband have a car '' ? ?
`` Got us an old station wagon .
Need it for the job '' .
She shook her head .
I knew she was lying .
He'll get a fair trial .
I'll tell him -- if I see him '' .
I tried not to act scared .
That Jaguar could really barrel along .
"Lighting my pipe , I took a walk ."
The Harbor is a big yachting basin in the summer .
"He said , `` You bet ."
Bob Moore is plumb crazy about blue fishing '' .
"I dropped into the doctor's office , picked up my forms ."
"If she moved gracefully , she was clumsy at it ."
I got into the front seat .
I waited a few minutes and she sat up .
But the police have dropped the case .
`` Why not ? ?
The police have finished with it .
"`` Still , they may not want to rent it '' ."
`` That's your headache .
"Once inside , keep your eyes open '' ! !"
`` For what '' ! !
Alec was growing more and more skeptical .
The hotel people will have scoured and vacuumed it .
"Ten to one , it's even been redecorated '' ! !"
`` I'm betting on that chance .
Interview the bellboy and chambermaid who waited on Beauclerk .
Study the topography of the suite .
Soak up local color .
Reenact everything Beauclerk did .
`` Cheerful way to spend an evening '' ! !
A sudden thought wiped the smirk from his face .
The chief's eyes gleamed .
`` That is exactly what I'm hoping for .
"After all , the murderer is still at large ."
And the key to the suite is still missing '' .
Diana Beauclerk was a second-rate actress living in New York .
Two weeks ago she had gone west to Pearson City .
"Daniel Forbes , her divorced husband , lived there ."
Stacy said he left her suite at nine forty-five p.m. .
No one saw Stacy leave .
No other visitor inquired for her that evening .
Colt revolver in her brain .
Her door was locked and the key was missing .
So was the gun .
Forbes had motive and Stacy had opportunity .
He studied the night clerk as a man measures an adversary .
`` I'd like the room I had the last time '' .
"`` Certainly , sir '' ."
"The clerk was young and limp , with a tired smile ."
`` Do you recall the number '' ? ?
The clerk's smile congealed .
`` That suite is taken '' .
The clerk's glance followed Alec's .
"`` We have better rooms vacant now '' , he babbled ."
`` Larger and more comfortable .
At the same rate '' .
"Alec's face was dark , blunt , and sulky ."
He always looked impertinent and he could look dangerous .
He was looking dangerous now .
He raised his voice .
There was a sudden stillness in the lobby .
Even the bellboys on their bench were listening .
The clerk's eyes flickered .
`` Of course not '' ! !
`` Anybody with a contagious disease been in there '' ? ?
`` No '' ! !
The clerk was almost hysterical .
`` I don't believe it '' .
`` There might be a story in it '' .
`` St-story '' ? ?
"`` I'm with the Syndicated Press , Feature Service ."
It was blackmail and the clerk knew it .
"`` There is no story '' , he piped tremulously ."
He could feel eyes on his back .
"A thick , crimson carpet muffled every footfall ."
It was a neat setup for murder .
Hastily the boy switched on a ceiling light .
The room looked normal and even commonplace .
There was no hint of a violent struggle now .
The blue rug was suspiciously bright and new .
It had never been stained with blood .
Alec played the part of an innocent tourist .
`` Is there anything wrong with this room '' ? ?
The boy dropped his eyes .
The boy raised his eyes .
"`` Listen , mister ."
`` Were you on duty here two weeks ago '' ? ?
"Then , `` I'm not talking ."
He was in a hurry to get out of the room .
Alec gave him a tip and let him go .
"Alone , Alec examined the doors ."
It was just quarter of nine .
"Women didn't use white face powder nowadays , he recalled ."
"They used pink , tan , or cream powder ."
Alec glanced into the bathroom .
"It seemed clean now , but Alec decided against a bath ."
He crawled into bed and switched off the light .
In less than five minutes Alec was asleep .
He never knew just what woke him .
Yet suddenly he was wide-awake .
Alec heard a faint sound .
For the sound was inside the room .
"He let his eyelids droop and breathed heavily , feigning sleep ."
The sound was coming nearer .
"When the neon sign faded out , the shadow disappeared ."
"Cautiously Alec tensed his muscles , ready to jump ."
The bedsprings betrayed him with a creak .
He lashed out blindly with his right .
"There was a thick , squashy crack of fist on flesh ."
Something hard grazed his knuckles .
Rough cloth rasped his fist .
Something heavy shook the floor as it dropped .
"Alec waited a moment , on guard ."
Again he groped for the light switch .
On the bare floorboards a man lay face down .
"He had a short , heavy , powerful body ."
Alec promptly removed the gun .
He was familiar with this type .
But he was surprised to meet it here .
Diana Beauclerk had no connection with the underworld .
The man's eyelids fluttered .
He opened his eyes .
`` What are you doing here '' ? ?
The man made no reply .
His eyes were dazed .
His lips were bruised and swollen where Alec had hit him .
`` Did you kill Diana Beauclerk '' ? ?
"`` Oh , come on , snap out of it ! !"
Or I'll turn you over to the police '' ! !
The silence was getting on Alec's nerves .
"The man opened his mouth , but no words came ."
`` Don't you speak English '' ? ?
The man opened his mouth wider .
A forefinger pointed toward his gullet .
Alec leaned forward to look .
He was sharpening his razor .
What has this to do with the present ? ?
"Much , I assure you ."
"They had learned , both of them , about Abraham Wharf ."
That's why I beg you not to forget him .
His ghost is not laid .
You know the facts ; ;
they are set forth in your own newspapers .
The ' when ' you know ; ;
"Places , too , have their haunting qualities ."
There's a different hall-mark on them .
We'll walk up there later .
It's perhaps a mile from here where we sit .
"A fascinating pursuit , I assure you ."
"That's your setting , and a sinister one ."
Please get that in your reports .
It accounts for so many things .
"Handley lived further on , at Pigeon Cove ."
"They were both painters , ( They were ? ?"
What should one say ? ?
"Sea-road , railroad , lack of water , killed Dogtown ."
I knew Red and Handley well .
"As I said , they were both painters ."
"They married cousins , Anta and Freya Norberg ."
"Pretty girls among them , with blonde hair and pert faces ."
But you've got to know both .
What's below the water-line interests me also .
Like his glossy black hair .
"Too many outside manners , to my taste ."
"A real gentleman , I feel , would do neither ."
"Red was small and fine-boned , like ivory-inlay ."
He too asked to see the same page .
Le rouge et le noir .
The Beech Pasture had suddenly become valuable .
"Fortunately , I knew almost exactly what the will had said ."
"It began with a preamble , of course ."
I felt it would be inopportune to disclose my presence .
One other cause of jealousy between them I must tell you .
I suppose Handley knew it .
By such touches the pattern takes shape .
You would call these the motives of crime .
"Not much to shoot , but there are a few pheasant ."
Any more than they have the sense to eat mussels .
That was the day Red was said to have gone away .
"Oh yes , he'd talked about doing so ."
"Anta , his wife , never seemed to mind ."
That's what the man had said .
Was the man drunk or crazy or both ? ?
Why hadn't he noticed it before ? ?
"No , the man was not drunk"
He wondered how he got tied up with this stranger .
"But , of course , he remembered now ."
Haney hadn't given it much thought at the time .
Phil was like that .
Haney managed a weak laugh .
"`` Guess I can't think of anyone , Pete ."
A faint crease appeared between the man's eyebrows .
"`` I think you aren't taking me seriously , Phil ."
And everybody has some kind of grudge .
I believe in returning favors .
I'll do anything for somebody I like .
"It won't cost you a cent , Phil ."
Go ahead and try me '' ! !
Phil rubbed his forehead wearily .
He was beginning to feel woolly .
"He says the neighbors complain , but I don't believe it ."
The man closed his eyes and nodded .
"When he looked up again , he seemed almost contented ."
Give me your address .
It will take a little time .
I want to study your landlord's habits and movements first .
"You see , I always make it look like an accident ."
"Maybe suicide , if it looks reasonable ."
In that way there's no trouble for the customer '' .
Haney's eyebrows flew up .
`` Customer '' ? ?
"`` It's my line of work '' , he said"
Phil shrugged and ignored him .
He went back to work Monday .
By Wednesday the landlord was still alive .
"Inside the lobby , people were standing around , talking excitedly ."
The landlord had died .
He had apparently been alone .
"But after all , why should they ? ?"
"The stranger really had nothing to do with it , of course"
So you thought I didn't mean what I said .
"However , Haney knew it was not a dream ."
This favorite grievance was not the landlord .
He had already quite forgotten about him .
His real grievance was Lolly .
He hadn't even noticed -- what was his name ? ?
-- he hadn't seen him sit down .
"Pete frowned slightly , then became sad and moody ."
But there was no trouble .
"To break the uncomfortable silence , Haney began to talk ."
`` But why pay her bills ? ?
`` Then she'd get half of everything I have .
Community property deal -- you know .
She can drop dead '' ! !
I came out here to retire .
You should have told me about her before '' .
Then a wild thought ran circles through his clouded brain .
"`` No offense intended '' , he said gently ."
"`` But it's just that -- well , you know ."
"After all , I didn't know you , Pete ."
It could have been an accident '' .
His eyes burned feverishly .
"`` Yes , yes '' , he muttered impatiently ."
`` Of course it looked like an accident .
"Let me prove it , Phil ."
I think I can manage one more favor for you '' .
Haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass .
"`` C'mon '' , he whispered ; ;"
"I went through and down , into pitch darkness ."
"He said , `` Jist stay still ."
I'll pull the boards back and then get us a light .
Jist stay where you are '' .
"`` You first '' , I said ."
He drank and handed it back .
"`` Nice place '' , I told him ."
"I know where he is , right near here ."
Could he join the party and sleep here tonight too ? ?
His `` sure-sure '' was enthusiastic this time .
He put the bottle down .
"Charlie was waiting , leaning against a building front ."
"`` Perfect set-up '' , I told him ."
On the way I'll give you the scoop '' .
On the way I gave him the scoop .
And a blaring final chord from the jazz group .
But we could wait all right ; ;
there was no hurry .
We'd heard the record together once .
The second bottle passed a few times .
He had a capacity ; ;
It was a lead pipe cinch .
"Out cold , if not dead ; ;"
He was holding the piece of lead pipe out to me .
"`` We don't want to know whether he's dead , yet ."
I gauged that blow to be borderline .
To kayo him and maybe or maybe not kill .
"I dug him , I saw his point ; ;"
"Charlie said , `` Good boy ."
"That did it , if mine didn't ."
And we'll never know which .
"All right , now I'll give you a hand '' ."
I nodded to Charlie .
`` Let's put him down again the way he was .
It's a more natural position '' .
`` How do you feel '' ? ?
"`` Cool '' , I told him ."
`` What do you feel '' ? ?
Well maybe I'm exaggerating .
"Now , first question : the bottles ."
"`` Take them '' , I said ."
Now '' -- He looked around .
`` I've been careful about fingerprints .
How about you '' ? ?
Same goes for the rough cement of the ledge .
"Besides , I doubt if the cops will even try dusting ."
`` We can't take a chance on that .
Let's do that '' .
"We went once more over every point , then triple-checked ."
"In fact , nobody saw us , cop or citizen ."
"Which , if it matters , was one A.M. ."
It had gone like clockwork .
How safe is too safe ? ?
Thinking like that can get you into a padded pad .
We decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow .
But we were really going to do it .
We shook hands on it .
Charlie would get there early because he had the key .
Charlie had brought food and we'd decided on no drinks .
I drew diagrams and floor plans ; ;
"`` Wait a minute , Charlie '' , I said ."
"`` One thing we haven't discussed , expense money ."
"`` All right , I'll come clean ."
A couple of hundred .
"`` Solid '' , I said ."
"I took a deep breath , and the plunge ."
"`` In that case , let's not draw ."
I'll go to bat first .
But your friend Manny can go any time '' .
He grinned and clapped me on the shoulder .
"`` I was hoping you'd say that , Willy ."
But I wouldn't have suggested it .
Self's integrity was and is and ever had been .
Mike remained in trance ; ;
He had been weary ; ;
`` Hi '' ! !
"My , you look chipper '' ."
`` I feel fine ! !
Where is everybody '' ? ?
Mike felt disappointed that Mahmoud had left ; ;
he wanted to explain his new grokking .
Are you hungry '' ? ?
"`` Sure , I'm hungry '' ! !"
"They went downstairs , loaded a tray lavishly ."
`` Let's take it outside .
It's plenty warm '' .
"`` A fine idea '' , Mike agreed ."
`` Warm enough to swim -- real Indian summer .
I'll switch on the floods '' .
"`` Don't bother '' , Mike answered ."
`` I'll carry the tray '' .
He could see in almost total darkness .
his foster parents had taught him to see .
"`` Okay , take the tray ."
I'll switch on the underwater lights .
That'll be plenty to eat by '' .
Mike liked having light up through the ripples ; ;
"it was a goodness , beauty ."
"`` Mike , there's Mars ."
"It is Mars , isn't it ? ?"
Or Antares '' ? ?
`` It is Mars '' .
What are they doing on Mars '' ? ?
the question was too wide for the sparse English language .
plants are being taught to grow '' .
`` ' Taught to grow ' '' ? ?
`` Larry teaches plants to grow .
I have helped him .
"But my people -- Martians , I mean ; ;"
"Yes , I heard it in the news '' ."
Mike had not heard it ; ;
he had not known it until asked .
`` They should not be sad .
the Old Ones have cherished him '' .
`` You knew him '' ? ?
"He had his own face , dark and beautiful ."
But he was homesick '' .
"`` Oh , dear ! !"
Mike do you ever get homesick ? ?
For Mars '' ? ?
"`` At first I was homesick '' , he answered ."
`` I was lonely always '' .
He rolled toward her and took her in his arms .
`` But now I am not lonely .
I grok I shall never be lonely again '' .
Presently his water brother said breathlessly .
"`` Oh , my ! !"
That was almost worse than the first time '' .
"`` You are all right , my brother '' ? ?"
Kiss me again '' .
It is for growing closer .
Now we grow closer '' .
turn just a little .
Her answer was not in words .
This went faster than scheduled as the Martians were helpful .
The Old Ones neither helped nor hindered this plan ; ;
time was not yet .
the purpose was less immediate .
A funeral parlor chain was indicted for price-cutting .
Digby was not pleased with his promotion .
Eternity is no time for recriminations .
You too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me .
Afterwards you did well enough .
Same as with the Popes .
Some of them were warts until they got promoted .
"Digby calmed down , but made one request ."
Foster shook his halo .
`` You can't touch him .
You shouldn't have tried to .
"I'm helping you now , am I not ? ?"
"The Boss wants performance , not gripes ."
"Get Happy , junior '' ! !"
Digby heaved a deep ethereal sigh .
"`` Okay , I'm Happy ."
Where do I start '' ? ?
His household had gone through an upset .
"Anyhow , it was high time the boy was salted ."
The expense and time involved are astronomical .
that is all I can tell you about them .
`` How did you know '' ? ?
"`` Forgive me , Sandalphon '' , said Hal ."
`` But it was inevitable ! !
How could they not ? ?
"Besides , they were not the only impressions ."
"He was a good impresser , that Pornsen ."
He was my gapt in the creche .
He is now my block gapt .
"Swiftly , came the revulsion , the protest ."
"If I die , I die because I willed it so ."
"`` Please pardon me again , Sandalphon '' , said Hal ."
"`` No '' , said Macneff ."
And it leaves very soon '' .
`` You need a linguist '' ? ?
"Hal waited : Macneff paced some more , frowning ."
"`` A thousand pardons '' , said Hal ."
`` But I have just thought of one thing .
I am married '' .
"`` No problem at all '' , said Macneff ."
`` There will be no women aboard the Gabriel .
"Naturally , he couched the provision in obscure language ."
"`` I volunteer '' , said Hal ."
"`` Tell me more , Sandalphon '' ."
"And , somewhere in that enormous light , was his apartment ."
There was no such thing as an `` accident '' .
Hal felt sorry for Mary ; ;
"Yet , he told himself , this was the best way ."
their mutual torture would be over .
Hal doubted if this happy event would occur .
Mary was as frozen below the navel as he .
No matter who the candidate for marriage selected by the gapt
`` Hal Yarrow '' ! !
Said the whining voice .
But I might have known ! !
We seem to be bound by love ; ;
Sigmen himself must have foreseen it .
"Love to you , my ward '' ."
`` How wonderful to see your cherished self .
Here they would lie in suspended animation for many years .
These members would then unthaw the rest of the personnel .
"And , from the first , he faced a difficult task ."
The description of the Siddo syntax was very restricted .
This discovery caused Hal anxiety .
"Moreover , even getting this across would be difficult ."
"the sounds made by these organs were , therefore , dissimilar ."
Another obstacle was the grammatical construction of Siddo .
Consider the tense system .
The system of indicating gender varied according to tense .
There was nothing he could do but wait .
The dice were cast .
At last Gabriel spoke .
"`` We misjudged you '' , he said slowly ."
"Hesperus , you may speak '' ."
"`` Nevertheless , you were its agent ."
"Jack , what is the nature of this concept '' ? ?"
"His heart , he discovered , was pounding ."
"Between individuals , this process is called bargaining ."
Recovering the property was much less important '' .
"`` Strange '' , Gabriel said ."
`` And apparently impossible .
but this one was not nearly as long .
`` Then it is a matter of pleasure ; ;
of a more alive time .
"Yes , those could be commodities under this concept ."
This explained a great deal .
To this we of course agree '' .
Nothing less would serve .
Yet there was some precedent for it .
Suppose that this one were to work ? ?
If mankind could be convinced of that
It was worth trying .
"In fact , it had to be tried ."
but there was no small way to handle this one .
But he was too late .
He had lost his audience .
What's going on here ? ?
What's happened '' ? ?
`` Your brothers have been found .
They are on their way here '' .
I don't see them .
The instruments don't show them '' .
"`` You can't see them yet , Jack ."
They'll be in range in a short while '' .
No -- there was a tiny pip on the radar ; ;
and it was getting bigger rapidly .
"If that was the skiff , it was making unprecedented speed ."
"It was a startling , almost numenous sight ; ;"
"The skiff was not heading for the nursery , however ."
"Fuming , helpless , he watched them pass him ."
But where was it going ? ?
Almost surely he did ; ;
"If it was intentional , it was now also unnecessary ; ;"
"and whether intentional or not , the outcome would be disastrous ."
`` Hesperus '' ? ?
But I can't take you to Earth yet .
"Will you obstruct this , or will you help ? ?"
Therefore of course I will help '' .
"Always before , it had taken five minutes to --"
Hesperus was in there .
Ryan hefted his bulk up and supported it on one elbow .
He rubbed his eyes sleepily with one huge paw .
"`` Ekstrohm , Nogol , you guys okay '' ? ?"
He didn't say what would cure him ; ;
`` Ekstrohm '' ? ?
The facsiport rolled open on the landscape .
"That cold , empty sky was full of fire and light ."
"`` What will we need outside , Ryan '' ? ?"
"`` No helmets '' , the captain answered ."
"`` We can breathe out there , all right ."
It just won't be easy .
Nitrogen and oxygen are about it '' .
"`` Ryan , look over there '' , Nogol said ."
"Think they're intelligent , maybe hostile '' ? ?"
"`` I think they're dead '' , Ekstrohm interjected quietly ."
`` I get no readings from them at all .
"Sonic , electronic , galvanic -- all blank ."
"According to these needles , they're stone dead '' ."
"`` You hold down the fort , Nogol ."
Take it easy '' .
"`` Easy '' , Nogol confirmed ."
"Remember , when the little hand is straight up that's negative ."
`` But I'm ambidextrous '' .
Ryan told him what he could do then .
Ekstrohm nudged it with a boot .
"`` Hey , this is pretty close to a wart-hog '' ."
"`` Uh-huh '' , Ryan admitted ."
`` One of the best matches I've ever found .
"Well , it has to happen ."
Statistical average and all .
The surveyor looked sidewise at the captain .
The big man seldom gave out with such thoughts .
Ekstrohm cleared his throat .
`` What shall we do with this one ? ?
Dissect it '' ? ?
"Ryan nudged it with his toe , following Ekstrohm's example ."
"`` I don't know , Stormy ."
"No hands , for one thing ."
"Of course , that's not definite proof '' ."
"`` No , it isn't '' , Ekstrohm said ."
What killed them '' ? ?
`` Radiation '' ? ?
Any little dose of radiation might knock off these critters '' .
`` I don't know about that .
Maybe it would work the other way .
`` Then maybe it was the shockwave we set up .
Or maybe it's sheer xenophobia .
"`` Maybe '' , the captain admitted ."
`` At this stage of the game anything could be possible .
But there's one possibility I particularly don't like '' .
`` And that is '' ? ?
`` Suppose it was not us that killed these aliens .
I just hope it doesn't work on Earthmen too .
These critters went real sudden '' .
The Earthmen made camp outside the spaceship .
Ekstrohm was not asleep .
Now there could be an end to pretending .
There was no longer any need to hide .
But what was there to do ? ?
What had changed for him ? ?
It was small comfort for insomnia .
Some doctors had informed him he was mistaken about this .
Others admitted he was absolutely correct -- he never slept .
"Occasionally he fell into a waking , gritty-eyed stupor ; ;"
but he never slept .
"Naturally , he couldn't let his shipmates know this ."
He had to hide it .
The buddies invariably took advantage of him .
Ekstrohm had to hide his secret .
But the secret itself was just as hard .
"Behind him , his mates stirred without waking ."
The angry burnt-red face of Ryan greeted him .
What did you do with them '' ? ?
`` Do with what '' ? ?
`` The dead beasties .
All the dead animals laying around the ship '' .
"`` What are you talking about , Ryan ? ?"
What do you think I did with them '' ? ?
`` I don't know .
All I know is that they are gone '' .
`` Gone '' ? ?
Ekstrohm shouldered his way outside and scanned the veldt .
There was no ring of animal corpses .
Nothing but wispy grass whipping in the keen breeze .
"`` I'll be damned '' , Ekstrohm said ."
"`` You are right now , buddy ."
ExPe doesn't like anybody mucking up primary evidence '' .
"`` Where do you get off , Ryan '' ? ?"
`` Why pick me for your patsy ? ?
This has got to be some kind of local phenomenon .
Why accuse a shipmate of being behind this '' ? ?
Now comes this ! !
`` What could I do with your lousy dead bodies ? ?
What would I want with them '' ? ?
The tapes show that .
It was not a new experience to Ekstrohm .
Suspicion wasn't new to him at all .
"Look for them , will you ? ?"
"Take my word , can't you '' ? ?"
Ryan shook his head .
`` I don't think I can .
There's still such a thing as mental illness .
You may not be responsible '' .
"`` Don't try anything violent , Stormy ."
`` I wasn't planning on jumping you .
She lived and was given a name .
"instead of grabbing with hands , she manipulated mechanical extensions ."
She would be among the elite of her kind .
Very few committees ever looked past the first few photos .
She had tuned her sight to the proper degree .
"As she worked she absentmindedly crooned , producing a curious sound ."
Her hum became a gurgle of surprise .
I enjoyed my lessons '' .
Any other reaction would have been reported instantly .
Would you like to see my work '' ? ?
"Helva asked , politely ."
`` Work '' ? ?
"`` No , I say '' , the lady twittered ."
"The lady's eyes , unmagnified , bugged out ."
"If she could have blushed , she would have ."
`` You people don't have adjustable vision '' .
`` I had that in mind '' .
`` Which you are programed to compute '' ? ?
`` Of course '' .
`` Singing '' as applicable to herself required research .
Her own sound production equipment was essentially more instrumental than vocal .
"Shell people did not , strictly speaking , breathe ."
"When she awoke , she was the ship ."
The ship always chose its own partner .
"`` Hello , anyone at home '' ? ?"
`` Are you my partner '' ? ?
"She asked hopefully , as she recognized the Scout Service uniform ."
`` No one has come .
The sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive .
It would have killed you in the cabin .
Do you have anything for me '' ? ?
Mercer never noticed the needle touch his arm .
"He stumbled and fell , but it did not hurt ."
The many-bodied girl lay near him .
Mercer spoke to her .
`` Isn't it wonderful ? ?
"You're beautiful , beautiful , beautiful ."
I'm so happy to be here '' .
The woman covered with growing hands came and sat beside them .
She radiated warmth and good fellowship .
Mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming .
He struggled out of his clothes .
The two women babbled and crooned at him .
With most of his mind he was happy .
A painful stab hit him in the abdomen .
The drug went after the pain and swallowed it .
He forced himself to be deliberate .
Maybe I will grow another head .
That would make B'dikkat happy '' ! !
"Said she , `` I'm strong , too ."
"Remember , man , remember ."
People never live forever .
I do so believe in death '' ! !
Mercer smiled at her through his happiness .
`` Of course you can .
But isn't this nice ''
B'dikkat was sterilizing his knives .
Mercer wondered how long the super-condamine had lasted him .
He endured the ministrations of the dromozoa without screams or movement .
"He watched his own body with remote , casual interest ."
The Lady Da and the hand-covered woman stayed near him .
Time had no meaning .
The dromozoa fed him in their mysterious way ; ;
the drug canceled out his needs for cycles of the body .
At last he noticed a return of the inwardness of pain .
The pains themselves had not changed ; ;
He knew all the events which could take place on Shayol .
He remembered them well from his happy period .
Formerly he had noticed them -- now he felt them .
"She smiled at him with benign , remote happiness ; ;"
Mercer squeezed the man's shoulder .
"`` ' A good morrow to you , my boy ."
That's out of a play .
Did you ever see a play '' ? ?
`` You mean a game with cards '' ? ?
"`` Soon '' , said the half-man ."
That's why I think of plays .
We all know what is going to happen .
We all know when it is going to happen .
`` What's a ' scene ' '' ? ?
`` Is that the name for the needle '' ? ?
The half-man laughed with something close to real humor .
"`` No , no , no ."
You've got the lovelies on the brain .
A scene is just a part of a play .
The pain seems short and the pleasure seems long .
Take it out of me '' ! !
It might have been several days .
It might have been several months .
Once again B'dikkat moved among them like a father ; ;
once again they clustered like children .
Mercer got the blissful needle .
He saw the child-face grimace as the head was cut ; ;
The next time it was two legs growing from his chest .
Then there had been another head beside his own .
He forgot the order .
He did not count time .
She had lost the extra torsos .
He had to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do it .
"Good luck , fellow '' ."
What persuaded the cow-man to remain on Shayol ? ?
What kept him happy without super-condamine ? ?
His own fate he accepted .
He staggered back to the group .
"The years , if they were years , went by ."
The land of Shayol did not change .
`` People never live forever '' .
There was no dream of escape for these people .
His handwriting was on a rock .
Nor did they care .
Dan Morgan told himself he would forget Ann Turner .
He was well rid of her .
He certainly didn't want a wife who was fickle as Ann .
But all of this was rationalization .
Each day he found himself thinking less often of Ann ; ;
He had plenty of work to do .
He had no idea how much time Budd would give him .
It could be some kind of trick Budd had thought up .
"Morgan watched the two figures for a time , puzzled ."
The boy licked his dry lips .
"He asked , `` Could we have a drink '' ? ?"
Morgan jerked his head toward the front door .
"`` In the kitchen '' , he said ."
There's water in the house '' .
She didn't move or say anything .
"Besides , she had a sweet face that attracted him ."
"They looked a good deal alike , Morgan thought ."
The girl dropped off to sleep .
`` Who are you and what happened to you '' ? ?
"`` I'm Billy Jones '' , the boy answered ."
`` That's my wife Sharon .
`` What are you doing here '' ? ?
`` Are we in Wyoming '' ? ?
`` About five miles north of the line '' .
Jones sighed as if relieved .
`` The town of Buckhorn's only about six miles from here .
Why didn't you go there '' ? ?
"`` We didn't want town work '' , Jones said ."
"`` This is a mighty empty country '' , Morgan said ."
`` There's only one more ranch three miles north of here .
You'd have starved to death if you'd missed both places '' .
`` Then we're lucky we got here .
"Could you give us a job , Mr. ''"
He dismissed the possibility at once .
The girl's thin face haunted him .
It wasn't the face of a killer .
He wasn't so sure about the boy .
There was more to this than Jones had told him .
They were running from something .
I guess you'd better go on in the morning '' .
"Sharon , she's cooked in a restaurant ."
"We'll work hard , Mr. Morgan '' ."
"`` I'll see '' , Morgan said ."
`` Right now you need a meal and a bath .
Your wife's in terrible shape '' .
"`` I know '' , Jones said dejectedly ."
"He said , `` I've got some supper ready '' ."
`` Who are you ? ?
How did we get here '' ? ?
`` I'm Dan Morgan .
This is the Rafter Aj .
"then she murmured : `` You're very kind , Mr. Morgan ."
`` Think you can walk to the table '' ? ?
`` Of course '' .
"She got to her feet , staggered , and almost fell ."
"She sat down at the table , shaking her head ."
"`` I'm sorry , Mr. Morgan ."
"`` And hungry '' , he said ."
`` Not much of a meal '' ? ?
`` Which are you '' ? ?
"`` We're not drunkards '' , she said ."
`` That's all I'm sure of '' .
"Your feet are in bad shape , Mrs. Jones ."
You'll have to go to town to see the doc '' .
"`` We'll see '' , Morgan said ."
`` Could you find me a needle and thread '' ? ?
`` My dress needs some work on it '' .
He said : `` I'm going to bed '' .
He nodded at the door in front of him .
`` That's my spare bedroom .
"`` You're awfully kind '' , the girl said ."
`` We'll pay you back if you'll let us .
"`` It's all right '' , he said ."
`` I get up early .
You'd better sleep '' .
We haven't slept together since we started .
"`` We got fired '' , Jones said ."
`` We had to do something '' .
`` You can't stay here with me .
It's late and you said they'd be here by dawn '' .
`` You can't make me go '' .
Gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock .
Against that other man he could rally his anger ; ;
against this bent man in the chair he was powerless .
`` Do you remember Big Charlie '' ? ?
`` He stuck with me all these years .
"My men , they all left me ."
"I didn't understand why , Clay ."
They just all cleared out .
I treated them fair ''
`` You don't hate me any more '' ? ?
`` Come here '' .
Gavin slipped his arms around his chest and hugged him fiercely .
I saw you driftin away -- but I tried .
Now there's nothin left of me .
That would mock me too much ! !
"`` I'll go , Clay '' ."
Clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back .
The eyes followed him fearfully .
There isn't much time .
I'll saddle the horses and bring them round .
The mare had backed away .
"`` You take it easy , boy '' , Clayton whispered ."
`` She doesn't want you now .
"You take it easy , your time will come '' ."
"Gavin stood on the porch , a thin figure ."
Clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps .
`` To a ranch in the valley .
There's someone there I have to see .
We may take her with us -- to California .
"I don't know yet , it's crazy ; ;"
I have to think about it .
But California is where we're goin '' .
Gavin began to nod .
`` That's a new land .
A man could make a mark there .
"`` Yes , like a father and son '' ."
"`` I made you what you are '' , Gavin whispered ."
`` I made you so you could stand up .
I made you a man '' .
"`` Yes , Gavin , you did '' ."
"`` Help me up , Clay ."
"Help me up , I feel kind of stiff '' ."
"Clayton lifted him gently into the saddle , like a child ."
"`` I hate to leave my garden '' , Gavin said ."
`` They'll trample it down .
I loved my garden '' .
`` It will grow again -- in California '' .
"`` I loved this valley '' , he whispered huskily ."
Lived alone by the river .
"It was nice then , so peaceful and quiet ."
There was no one but me .
I don't want to leave it '' .
Clayton swung into the saddle and whacked the stallion's rump .
they rode at a measured pace through the valley .
Dawn would come soon and the night was at its coldest .
Then at last the darkness began to dissolve .
But the liquor had flushed their courage .
"Lester heard their muttering , saw their eyes reveal their desire ."
"That's what you wanted , isn't it ? ?"
"Clayton is with him , takin him out of the valley ."
"`` Keep out of this '' , Purvis snarled ."
"`` He's not your brother , he's Gavin's son ."
Joe Purvis was thinking back many years .
He wouldn't even dance with her at Gavin's party .
He treats her like she was dirt .
"`` You're Gavin's son '' , Joe Purvis had said ."
He turned to Lester .
He meant to help Gavin all the time .
"He made a fool of you , Lester '' ."
There are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place .
Lester's hand fluttered to Cabot's shoulder .
The boy jerked away .
`` He killed Tom -- do you understand that '' ? ?
Purvis and Silas Pettigrew were the last to leave .
He looked over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers .
They neither gained nor fell back .
He rode low on the mare's neck .
Gavin's face was bloodless with excitement .
He did not look back ; ;
Now they were riding to kill him .
"California is too far , he thought ."
He would never reach California .
The sentry was not dead .
"He was , in fact , showing signs of reviving ."
A bayonet hung in a belt scabbard .
He was partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat .
Mike stripped these from him and donned them .
They dragged him inside the building .
"Fiske joined them , unsteady on his feet ."
"Julia , seeing the bandage , rushed to him ."
`` You are hurt '' ! !
He turned to Susan and kissed her on the cheek .
"`` Thank you , My dear '' , he said ."
`` You are very brave '' .
`` We'll talk later .
"First , we've got to get out of here '' ."
"`` We'll grab horses '' , Dean said ."
But it at least offered him a chance for living .
He had none here .
The guerrilla bivouac remained silent .
Light showed in the orderly room across the parade ground .
Someone evidently was on duty there .
No doubt there would be men guarding the horses .
He handed the guard's rifle to Fiske .
`` We'll stampede the rest .
You stay with the ladies .
He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol .
Susan halted Dean and kissed him .
He felt unutterably weary .
Dean turned from Susan and took Julia Fortune in his arms .
"He kissed her also , and with deep tenderness ."
She too began to weep .
He released her and joined Mike .
"`` All right '' , he said ."
"Mike only said , `` Later '' ."
"`` Be careful , McLish '' ! !"
`` The way you were careful '' ? ?
He wanted no more sentimental scenes with her .
He might say or do something foolish .
Something all of them would regret .
He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol .
"`` Stay well back of me '' , he said ."
It was pierced by a wagon gate built of two wings .
One wing stood open .
"They were tethered , army style , on stable lines ."
A voice spoke near-at-hand .
`` Who's that '' ? ?
"Just me '' , Mike said ."
"`` Is that you , Bill '' ? ?"
He located his man .
Mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol .
But the luck that had been running their way left him .
The guard instinctively parried the blow with his rifle .
The bullet went wide .
Mike swung the pistol in a savage backlash .
The startled horses began rearing on their tethers .
Dean came rushing up .
`` Are you hit '' ? ?
"`` No , but the fat's in the fire '' ! !"
`` There's no chance now of all of us getting away .
You'll have to try it alone '' .
`` Up you go '' ! !
`` Ride '' ! !
Dean resisted Mike's attempt to push him toward the horse .
`` Why not you '' ? ?
`` Dammit '' ! !
`` You're lighter than me .
It's our only chance now .
Try to find these Feds .
You're the one that's taking the big chance '' .
`` Favor him and save something in case you hit trouble .
Watch out for Apaches when it comes daylight .
You might need it .
Then he was on his way at a gallop .
He lifted a screeching war whoop .
That touched off a total stampede .
He darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there .
These poured through the gate and joined the flight .
`` Apaches '' ! !
`` They're stealin' the stock '' ! !
His shout had been taken up and repeated .
Durkin and Calhoun came running from the post .
They had pistols in their hands .
They bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar .
They followed the others toward the east gate .
Mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings .
The area was deserted .
Mike crawled to the door and peered in .
The orderly room seemed to be deserted .
"A lantern hung from a peg , giving light ."
Shouldering the load he peered from the door .
He set his bundle down .
He picked up the powder canister and ran out .
Powder flame gushed beneath the wagon .
The stockade was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted him .
They realized the truth .
Bullets began to snap past him .
Another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down .
Guerrillas were racing toward him .
Susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door .
Some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak .
He peered from a loophole .
"Guerrillas were only a dozen yards away , charging the house ."
He dropped a man with the first bullet .
That halted the rush .
The guerrillas scattered for cover .
The wagons were burning fiercely .
The mudwagon had caught fire also .
The blaze was spreading to the frame buildings .
The guerrillas realized they faced a new problem .
`` Gawdamighty '' ! !
`` There goes our grub an' ammunition '' ! !
`` Get a bucket line going '' ! !
But what few containers they found were inadequate .
Both buildings were in flames .
The heat drove the guerrillas back .
The roof of the command post began to buckle .
`` Drag the wagons to the spring '' ! !
`` Run 'em right into the spring ! !
One of the wagons erupted a massive pillar of flame .
A sizable supply of powder had been touched off .
But it had missed the bone and had passed on through .
Keep this to yourself '' .
"Reverend Jason , looking worried , hurried toward us ."
"`` Anything wrong , cap'n ? ?"
The men seem to think so '' .
`` Dirion found a large war party south of us .
"They'll probably attack at dawn '' , Montero said ."
There's a large war party on their way '' ! !
They all flew into action .
The Aricaras treated us like friends .
Oso gave me an unruffled look .
`` What would you have done in Montero's moccasins ? ?
He shook his head .
`` Mr. Manuel did that in the war .
He did that with all the Nations .
I saw that letter .
"`` But that was war '' , I said ."
`` There's no war on now '' .
"`` You're wrong , Matt ."
`` That's why this company's important .
Once we get over the mountains others will come along .
That's why the Trust don't want us to make it .
"Surprisingly , he had told the others what he had done ."
"`` I think Montero did right '' , Amy said firmly ."
`` Let the savages kill each other .
What do we care '' ? ?
Reverend Jason was understandably bitter .
`` It was a terrible thing to do .
Our camp was in the center of a wide valley .
The pony herd was the one flaw in our defense ; ;
"Buckets were filled , the herd fed and watered ."
The worst part had been the waiting ; ;
"Oso slept unconcernedly , his rifle cradled in his arms ; ;"
I didn't catch a wink .
It was a relief when they finally came .
"`` Hold your fire '' , Montero was shouting ."
`` Wait until my shot .
I'll shoot the first man who doesn't '' .
I could see them in my sights .
They were about a mile off ; ;
under me the ground quivered slightly .
Gradually they emerged as men .
Gray Eyes was in the lead .
jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest .
He was naked except for a clout .
I found his chest in my sights .
It had a red circle .
The circle came nearer and nearer .
At first I thought he had missed .
Gray Eyes remained erect .
The feathered lance was still above his head .
I squeezed the trigger .
He jerked once in the grass and lay still .
`` If you're goin' to kill 'em -- ! !
Kill 'em '' ! !
"The Aricaras broke under the devastating fire , wheeled and retreated ."
`` Lead up ! !
They'll be back '' ! !
A rifle cracked ; ;
the square head fell over .
There was a ragged volley .
He was dead before he hit the ground .
`` Wait for the charge ! !
"The charge , I tell you '' ! !"
The sharp cries at the end of the valley were faint .
They grew louder as the Indians charged again .
"`` Gray Eyes is back , , Montero said ."
I could see the blood running down his chest .
I forgot to aim .
In my sights I watched him looming bigger and bigger .
Montero's shot had caught him high in the chest ; ;
there was no doubt he was dying .
Again we waited for Montero .
The horses were only several lengths away when he fired .
The bullet flung Gray Eyes from his horse .
But a few reached our wall .
"Reverend Jason got one , the Canadians the others ."
The ponies were almost uncontrollable .
This time more of them hurdled the barrier .
It sounded like a man kicking a melon .
"I could smell woodsmoke , grease , and oil ."
Coming over the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil .
The Aricaras made one last desperate charge .
None of them reached our walls again .
The few survivors grudgingly turned away .
It wouldn't matter to a fool like you .
It would to me '' .
"`` All right '' , Wilson said quickly ."
`` The fire's too big .
And I appreciate the advice '' .
He was losing patience again .
She had helped him change his mind .
"`` I'm not advising you '' , she said ."
`` I'm telling you .
That fire's too big .
Let it burn down .
He was taken aback .
It took him a long time to compose himself .
"`` There's some mistake '' , he said finally ."
`` You're right about the fire .
But you're wrong about the rest of it .
I'm not leaving in the morning .
Why should I ? ?
I own the place '' .
It didn't seem to tell her anything .
She studied it for a long time .
`` You own this place '' ? ?
`` You bought it '' ? ?
"`` From a man in St. Louis '' , Wilson said ."
Maybe you know him '' .
`` I know him .
My father ran him off here six years ago '' .
Wilson didn't say anything .
"He stood watching the girl , wondering what was coming next ."
"`` Carwood didn't tell you that '' , she said ."
"`` No '' , Wilson said ."
`` But it's understandable .
And it doesn't make any difference .
He sold me a clear title .
"I have it with me , right here ."
If you want to see '' --
"`` Never mind '' , she said sternly ."
I meant what I said about that fire .
Be sure it's out when you leave .
I'll let you go back to doing the dishes now '' .
"It was meant to insult him , and didn't quite succeed ."
`` It doesn't hurt .
"It might hurt you , though ."
Somebody might mistake you for a woman '' .
He wiped the blood from his cheek .
`` I ought to '' -- he said .
If you were a man '' --
"`` She isn't , mister '' ."
"The voice came from behind him , and Wilson turned ."
"He was tall and dark-skinned , a half-breed , Wilson thought ."
"`` She's not a man , mister '' , he said ."
If you've got any ideas '' .
He raised the Winchester and pointed it at Wilson's chest .
`` I thought I told you to stay home '' .
The scar looked pure white in the half-darkness ; ;
"his eyes were black and deep-set , and expressionless ."
`` I can take care of this .
It's no job for you '' .
He took it without flinching .
"`` I said go home , Joseph ."
You've got no business up here '' .
The half-breed didn't answer this time .
It made Wilson wonder .
He watched the half-breed as he turned silently .
Wilson brushed the dust from his coat .
`` Who was that '' ? ?
`` Your personal guard ? ?
You're pretty hard on him '' .
`` He's a friend .
His name's Joseph Sanchez .
Is there anything else you want to know '' ? ?
"`` Not now '' , Wilson said ."
`` I guess I'll find out soon enough .
You've got blood on your cheek .
It must have got there when you fell against me '' .
She wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat .
`` I've had enough of that .
I've had enough of you .
You took me by surprise .
But I'll know how to handle you next time '' .
She finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle .
He had forgotten that she was so pretty .
"He had known women like that , one woman in particular ."
And one had been too many .
And determined not to show it .
"`` Go to sleep '' , he said ."
`` Both of you .
There's better things to do than listen to something like that .
"Not tonight , at any rate ."
He had a feeling that the girl meant trouble .
Already some of the pain had gone from Amelia's death .
Not all of it .
But they were starting a new life .
The land wasn't all Wilson had expected of it .
"good grass , good water ."
And there was a house ; ;
"livable perhaps , but badly in need of repairs ."
It hadn't started out that way .
Kathy was already in the wagon .
"They were going to town , and they were both excited ."
He had an uneasy feeling about it .
"That girl last night , what was her name ? ?"
But there was water .
"A warm breeze played across it , moving it like waves ."
all dusty and sunbaked .
The place was quiet .
under the circumstances I was only too willing to confess all .
I was nearly thirty at the time .
"It was dark and , I sensed , very large ; ;"
Sometimes I was aware of people moving about in the darkness .
Drifting here and there .
"Squatting , as if waiting ."
The pulsing glow of a cigarette .
The clerk paid them no attention .
His job simply consisted in registering new men .
When the phone rang he answered it .
Baldness was attacking his pate .
But it was not easy for him and he often slipped .
I felt certain he was really a spineless little man .
His hat ( the cause of his baldness ? ?
Everything about the clerk was trivial .
With distaste I saw him assume a pompous air .
When he saw me coming he turned his radio off .
He made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf .
What limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me .
I withdrew my hand .
"When suitably lighted , what would it look like ? ?"
This sort of petty vigilance annoyed me .
I felt certain it was self-appointed .
I lived in a state of suspense because of it .
I had signed it off on the forms .
"I did not despair , however ; ;"
far from it ! !
Large warehouses flanked the street on which the hall fronted .
It resembled nothing I'd ever seen before .
Meanwhile spring had passed well into summer .
Cigarette butts littered the floor .
I stopped by the counter .
I rapped my knuckles on the counter .
The director came to the door .
"He wore perforated , white-topped shoes ; ;"
He did not look at them now .
"He spoke , in a voice as immaculate as his appearance ."
Why had I registered ? ?
These questions did not surprise me ; ;
`` Tie him up '' .
Rankin sneered at him .
He dumped me in solitary twice '' .
Barton caught the lighter man's shoulder and swung him around .
"`` Let's get one thing straight , you and me ."
The only reason we brought you was to get Miller out .
Fred Rankin looked at him .
There was no chance .
There was no moon .
They had chosen this night purposely .
"Two men were on duty inside , playing pinochle , relaxed ."
They looked up in surprise as Powers came in .
`` What are you doing out of the block '' ? ?
`` I've got to have help '' .
They stared at him .
The sergeant in charge climbed to his feet .
`` What's wrong with him '' ? ?
`` He's having some kind of a fit '' .
The sergeant turned to the door .
`` One sound and you're dead '' .
Powers had not followed .
Powers was covering the remaining guard .
The man half-reached for the cord of the alarm bell .
Powers knocked his arm aside .
Even Barton could not quite believe it .
It had gone without a hitch .
Five minutes later they reached the horses .
Foster had brought extra clothing also .
"A good man , Emmett ."
Barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to Powers .
`` I won't even try to thank you '' .
The ex-prison guard was embarrassed .
I did it for the valley .
You're the only man the Night Riders will follow .
We've been starving and I don't like to starve '' .
`` Good luck '' .
The murderer lifted his head .
`` Meaning you want me to ride out '' ? ?
`` You aren't one of us .
There's nothing for you here '' .
`` I got no place to go '' .
But ten years in prison had taught him realities .
`` Bury those uniforms so they won't be found '' .
Carl Dill was neither a rancher nor a valley man .
He had done time for the theft .
The one thing they had in common was their hatred .
Both hated Donald Kruger .
The old Haskell mine '' .
Mitch Barton knew the place .
`` How do the valley people feel '' ? ?
`` As mad as ever .
Did you find him '' ? ?
`` He's in Morgan's Ferry '' .
Barton half-straightened in surprise .
`` What's he doing there '' ? ?
`` Dealing faro '' .
`` Dealing faro ? ?
How come '' ? ?
Barton cursed under his breath .
Your cousin Finley saw to that .
"He's quite a rat , you know ."
He sold out to Kruger's men .
He's informed them of everything you've ever written him .
He wants your ranch '' .
"He said tensely , `` All right ."
Let's go get the boy '' .
Dill had come up also .
`` I was afraid of this .
I almost didn't tell you '' .
`` If you hadn't I'd have killed you '' .
`` But you can't ride into the Ferry .
That's what they'll expect you to do .
They'll be there waiting for you .
I understand how you feel about the child .
Barton's voice was rougher than Dill had ever heard it .
`` I never saw him .
My wife died in childbirth after I was sent away .
`` I can't leave him there .
I've got to get the boy .
It reached Donald Kruger in his massive home in Burlingame .
It reached the mines at North San Juan and Bloomfield .
Creighton Hague sat in his office above the Ione pit .
The building was dwarfed by the scene outside .
A million dollars' of gold a month .
A million tons of rock and soil and brush .
The monitors ran twenty-four hours each day .
Fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt .
He lived and breathed for the mining company .
Hague had never accustomed himself to Kodyke .
Even Hague was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was Kodyke .
He knew nothing about the man's history .
Kodyke was to head the dread company police .
He ran the change rooms .
He threw out the hi-graders .
Hague squeezed down his uneasy dislike .
`` This is Mitchell Barton .
He broke out of Folsom last night .
Apparently he bribed one of the guards .
We want him back there or we want him dead '' .
`` Dangerous '' ? ?
"`` Dangerous , yes ."
You know how the ranchers in the valley are .
They blame us for all their troubles .
Ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches .
We don't want Barton's Night Riders loose again '' .
"As she drove , she thought about her plan ."
It was really quite simple .
"Perhaps it was insane , Pamela thought ."
Perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream .
No wonder Melissa responded so completely to its beckoning .
Pamela felt calm and peaceful as she walked along .
"today , on the contrary , it seemed utterly reasonable ."
Success depended upon maintaining her equanimity ; ;
The forest took on an impersonal aspect .
Pamela shook her head .
She must not think about time .
That was another one of those traps .
"His bright , daylight mind would whistle away such images ; ;"
they would not dare to face his scoffing .
Pamela was glad Jim was nowhere near .
His presence would have interfered with her duty .
"Nevertheless , she continued to move upward ."
She was standing in a thick grove .
The thought made Pamela shudder .
A terrible chill swept through the grove .
It enclosed her clammy hands and twined around her ankles .
"It circled her thighs , exploring with its icy tentacles ."
But she did not know which way to go .
Does the mountain listen ? ?
She had to escape .
Every movement she made seemed unnecessarily noisy .
Twigs cracked loudly under her feet ; ;
bushes swished and scratched at her slacks ; ;
tree branches snapped as she pushed them ruthlessly away from her .
"Miraculously , she found exactly the right statement ."
`` I want to tell you something Thomas DeMontez Lord .
"`` But it don't matter a-tall '' , Lord supplied fondly ."
She yanked away from him furiously .
`` You shut up ! !
Do you hear me ? ?
You're going to listen '' ! !
He said he wanted very much to listen .
So would she mind speaking a little louder ? ?
"`` I think you stink , Tom Lord ! !"
So I can hear you while I'm checkin' the car .
He opened the door and got out .
Wasn't you goin' to say somethin' '' ? ?
"`` Aah , go on '' , she said ."
"And he really feels that way , she thought ."
"That's really all he's got , all he is ."
Just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package .
If I could make myself feel the same way
"She studied him hopefully , yearningly ; ;"
He wasn't a big man ; ;
rather on the medium side .
Neither was he very powerful of build .
"Just nothing , she told herself ."
"teetering , half-mincing walk ."
"`` Oh , cut it out , Tom '' ! !"
"`` This ain't your brand , maybe '' , Lord suggested ."
"On the other hand , howsomever , maybe you wouldn't either ."
`` How -- with what ? ?
There's nothing out here but rattlesnakes '' .
"`` Now , ain't it the truth '' ? ?"
Lord laughed with secret amusement .
"He pointed , cutting her off ."
`` See that wildcat '' ? ?
"sufficiently , at least , to get them back into town ."
A wildcatter had to be prepared for almost any emergency .
"`` Well , let's get going '' , she said impatiently ."
"`` I '' -- She broke off , frowning ."
`` What did you mean by that rattlesnake gag ? ?
Getting the boss rattlesnake to help you '' ? ?
"`` What else would I mean , anyways '' ? ?"
"She looked at him , lips compressed ."
"that is , to show no curiosity whatsoever ."
Lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering wheel .
He had a legitimate reason for wearing it .
`` So what's this all about '' ? ?
"He demanded , when Lord confronted him ."
It was the wrong thing to say .
The trouble was that he had virtually had to protest .
"So , `` How about it '' ? ?"
`` Why single me out on this permit deal '' ? ?
"`` We aim t' be see-lective , y'know ? ?"
"`` Look , Lord '' , he said hoarsely ."
"But you're all wrong , man ! !"
"I just do what I'm told , and '' --"
"McBride couldn't do either , of course ."
"Not immediately , as the deputy demanded ."
Not without a face-saving respite of at least a few minutes .
To do so would make his job well-nigh impossible .
Oil-field workers were a rough-tough lot .
A rabbit punch redoubled him .
But he couldn't keep up with them .
No more could he defend himself against them .
He seemed to be fighting not one man but a dozen .
"Why , he's going to kill me , he thought wildly ."
I meant him no harm .
I've given willful hurt to no man .
Beat me to death in front of a hundred people .
He couldn't see ; ;
he was long past the point of coherent thinking .
And nothing would be done about it .
Donna was like he was .
It especially bothered the older hands .
Supper would be ready within the hour .
The Maguire family was setting up a separate camp nearby .
"He'd come alone , without his wife and child ."
She wished that she could talk to her mother about it .
"`` Pat , get out of that creek ! !"
"You too , Sean ! !"
"Elena , you'll get mud all over your dress '' ! !"
"Tomas , she called him -- as the Mexican hands did ."
Whatever they are talking about ? ?
It bothered her that she probably would never know .
"Certainly , she wouldn't dare ask her father afterward ."
He held a cigarette in his right hand .
"It was burning away , forgotten ."
His face was clouded with unhappiness .
"`` Let's hear it , anyway '' ."
`` Wait a little while .
Let Senora Brannon live in her father's house for a time .
Give her time to miss you .
Maybe she will then come to you .
You need her even more than you need him '' .
"`` She won't change her mind '' , Brannon said ."
`` John Clayton will see to that '' .
`` But after a time away from you .
"`` A year , Luis ? ?"
How long should I wait '' ? ?
"`` Maybe in a year , Tomas ."
Hernandez looked suddenly uncertain .
Maybe I should withdraw my advice -- no '' ? ?
Brannon looked at Hank Maguire .
`` And you ? ?
What would you do in my place '' ? ?
Hank shook his head .
"`` I don't know , Tom ."
"With Maria and me , there's never any problem ."
You're going to need your woman .
And the boy will need his mother .
"If you take the one , you'd better take both '' ."
Brannon shook his head .
`` I won't force Beth to come against her will .
But I'm going to have my son '' .
"They were silent for a little while , each looking glum ."
"I am with you , of course , Tomas '' ."
"`` All right '' , Brannon said , rising ."
`` We'll ride out as soon as we've had chuck '' .
They had for cover both darkness and a summer storm .
Those who had slickers donned them .
It was to be nothing more than that .
There was to be no gunplay .
He didn't want to put himself outside the law .
The Ramirez brothers were also along .
They were all good men .
"It was dark early , because of the storm ."
Lighted windows glowed jewel-bright through the downpour .
He'd hoped to catch Jesse Macklin there .
"`` Probably just stepped out '' , he said ."
`` Maybe to have supper .
"Red , come along ."
The rest of you wait here '' .
"With Red Hogan , he rode to the Welcome Cafe ."
Hogan got down from the saddle and had a look inside .
`` Maybe he's at the hotel '' .
Brannon had no slicker .
But he felt no physical discomfort .
He was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain .
Brannon dismounted and climbed the steps .
"`` He's finished eating '' , Hogan said ."
`` Sitting with a cup of coffee now .
It shouldn't be long '' .
"It seemed long , at least to Tom Brannon ."
"`` Just come along '' , Brannon told him ."
`` Don't start anything you can't finish '' .
"`` Now , listen '' -- Macklin began ."
`` We'll talk over at your office '' .
"`` Brannon , I warn you '' ! !"
Hogan gripped the lawman's other arm .
"`` I'll remember you '' , he said ."
`` Every last one of you .
"As for you , Brannon '' --"
"`` Put your gun on the desk , Marshal '' ."
Red Hogan's patience ran out .
"`` Too much fooling around '' , he said ."
"`` Don't press your luck , badge-toter '' ."
`` Key '' ? ?
`` What for '' ? ?
`` Can't you guess '' ? ?
`` We're putting you where you won't come to harm .
Come on -- the key .
Get it out '' ! !
`` Damned if I will .
"Brannon , you've assaulted a law officer and '' --"
"They moved in on him , crowded him from all sides ."
"He swore , and said , `` All right ."
It's here in my pocket '' .
"`` Get it out '' , Brannon ordered ."
"Resignedly , Macklin turned to the back door ."
It was secured by an oversized padlock .
Its windows glowed with lamplight .
"He strode past the now frightened man , entered the house ."
The others followed Brannon inside .
"They tracked mud on the oaken floor , on the carpet ."
Their presence fouled the elegance of that room .
And their arrival caught John Clayton and Charles Ansley off guard .
The author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing .
The exception was an Iron Mountain settler named William Lewis .
He hadn't even pretended to be farming his spread .
His land had never been plowed .
He had done his rustling openly and boasted about it .
He had cursed at them and threatened them .
`` I'll be ready next time '' ! !
`` I'll be shootin' right back '' .
`` That's all I ask '' ! !
He never got that chance .
A bullet smashed directly into the center of William Lewis' chest .
It took some time to locate Horn .
But that indictment was never made .
The former scout's alibi couldn't be shaken .
The authorities had to release him .
"Publicly , he denied everything ."
The rustling problem was by no means solved .
The hired man ran over to help his boss .
And he collapsed and died instantly .
Ross had no intention of searching for the assassin .
There were no tracks of either hoofs or boots .
Not even an empty cartridge case could be found .
"He had lots of friends , then as always ."
`` Sportin' '' ! !
The tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stared in amazement .
`` Sportin' '' ! !
He echoed again in soft wonder .
`` I seen a lot o' things in my time .
The lesson had been learned .
The examples were plain .
This was the message found tacked to the cabin door .
"Keane left , within three days ."
"`` I have a little job for you , Charlie ."
I'm sure you won't mind doing me a small favor '' .
"Brenner's voice was oily , but Summers wasn't fooled ."
He moistened his lips uneasily .
`` It's very simple .
I just want you to take a message to Diane Molinari .
Tell her to come here to the hotel '' .
"Vastly relieved , Summers nodded and started toward the door ."
"`` One thing , Summers '' , Brenner said ."
`` You're not to mention my name .
Tell her Curt Adams wants to see her '' .
"Summers pulled up short , and turned around ."
Couldn't I just '' -- His voice trailed off into silence .
"Brenner continued to smile , but his eyes were cold ."
"`` You know , Summers '' , he said thoughtfully ."
`` Eagle's Nest ought to have a fire company .
Tell her to hurry '' .
`` Yes sir '' .
"His face pale , Summers headed for the street ."
Probably his horse would be close to where he was hiding .
Curt circled the house and located a barn out back .
"He could hear horses moving around inside , and nothing else ."
He found a match in his pocket and lit it .
Curt snuffed out the match .
"As Curt had hoped , the house door banged open ."
Curt moved over beside the door and waited .
The horse continued to snort .
"Jess cursed again , and entered the barn ."
"`` Before you try anything '' , he said ."
`` Remember what happened to Gruller '' .
Jess caught his breath in surprise .
"`` That's the stuff '' , Curt said ."
`` Just hold it that way '' .
You won't be needing this '' .
He moved up and lifted Jess's pistol out of its holster .
`` We ain't got nothing to talk about .
`` Your trigger-happy brother isn't in the house .
About now he's probably having supper .
Now turn around so I can see your face '' .
"`` You're about as dumb as they come , Adams ."
`` It's Ben Arbuckle we're going to talk about '' .
`` Arbuckle '' ? ?
`` I don't know nothin' about him '' .
"one with blood all over it , Arbuckle's blood '' ."
Who told you to do it ? ?
Was it Dutch Brenner '' ? ?
Curt was holding Jess's gun in his left hand .
`` No '' ? ?
Curt reached out and dropped Jess's pistol back into the holster .
He retreated a step and holstered his own .
"`` All right , Crouch ; ;"
we're on even terms .
Now draw '' ! !
Sweat bubbled out on Jess's swarthy face .
"`` Does this make it any easier , coward '' ? ?"
"`` I ain't drawin' against you '' , Jess said thickly ."
`` I heard how you outdrew Chico .
I ain't a gunslinger '' .
I just wanted to hear you say so '' .
"Somewhere in the distance , a woman screamed ."
He dropped his own beside it .
With a roar of pain and fury Jess made his attack .
It was like hitting a sack of salt .
An inch lower and it would have knocked him out .
Jess wasted a few seconds trying to yank them loose .
It gave Curt time to stagger to his feet .
His aim was hurried ; ;
so the pitchfork whistled over Curt's head .
By now Curt was seeing clearly again .
They made Jess double over .
What's going on out there '' ? ?
Jess didn't seem too sure himself .
Jess had had enough .
`` Tell me about Arbuckle ! !
"You killed him , didn't you '' ? ?"
`` He found out about you and Arbuckle talking .
The buckskin bolted out of the stall .
Curt moved in and picked up his gun .
"Leaving Jess's where it lay , he left the stall ."
"`` Get up , Crouch ."
We're going someplace '' .
Jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the door .
`` Who's in there '' ? ?
`` You're staying right here for a while .
This dirty coward just admitted killing Arbuckle .
I'm going to let him tell it to somebody else '' .
`` Get out of here .
Jess stumbled through the door .
`` Where're you takin' me '' ? ?
`` We're going to Marshal Woods's house .
Somebody in this town must still have some backbone '' .
"`` Honey '' , he whispered ."
His wounds need dressing now '' .
He released her reluctantly for her enthusiastic reunion with Old Hap .
Jackson was doing most of the talking .
there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening .
But his only hat was something else again .
`` Nate '' ! !
He bellowed to the retreating back directly in front of him .
`` I ain't going to fight you no more '' .
`` I know you ain't '' ! !
"Dan affirmed , feeling ten feet tall ."
Sally left her choring to stand beside Dan .
At first Matilda could not believe her own eyes .
I can see Dan .
And he's with the Jacksons '' ! !
`` What about Burnsides '' ? ?
"Hez asked , who still believed they'd have them to lick ."
`` They ain't even in sight '' ! !
"`` Nor Methodists , neither '' , she replied ."
"But she couldn't , not yet ."
Soon she saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them .
"Next morning , they moved on again ."
`` My souls' a-gracious '' ! !
"`` Shucks , Gran '' , they said almost in unison ."
`` That wasn't nothing at all '' ! !
"Leaning forward in her chair , Gran nearsightedly scrutinized Dan's face ."
"`` Quit ragging him , Gran '' , Rod protested ."
`` I ain't ragging him '' ! !
"`` Rheumatics worse , Pa '' ? ?"
"Dan grinned , and changed the subject ."
He's got the tightest running gear in the train now .
"Rod looked apprehensively ahead at the narrowing , precipice-walled gorge ."
Cobb's assent was tight .
`` You do the same .
"It's all I ask , Stevens '' ."
Russ ran up the steps quickly to the plank porch .
Fierce anger surged through Russ .
Stevens was nowhere in sight .
"`` What luck , Cobb '' ? ?"
Pat pushed through first .
Carmer himself was nowhere to be seen .
`` Where yuh goin' '' ? ?
It was the barkeep .
"Halting , Pat turned to survey him deliberately ."
"He did not reply , going on toward the back ."
He said no more .
Pat moved into it .
The door was locked .
"A single kick made it spring open , shuddering ."
Russ sprang through to bat it nimbly aside .
With a bellow Carmer lunged at him .
"He started to struggle up , heaving desperately ."
"`` Okay , Stevens ."
"I've drawn his fangs '' , he snapped ."
"`` Go through his pockets , will you ? ?"
`` Look at this '' ! !
Carmer's ingenious cache for his loot had been found .
"`` By golly , Stevens ! !"
`` Where else would he get it ? ?
"Count what you've got there , Cobb ."
We can soon tell '' .
His glance at Gyp Carmer was disdainful .
`` Shall we get out of here '' ? ?
He and Cobb clattered down the high steps to the street .
Neither spoke till they reached their horses .
"Pat paused there , looking across at the young fellow ."
He started to return it .
To his faint surprise Russ held up his hand .
"`` Not me '' , he ruled decidedly ."
`` I'll shove along home '' .
`` Whatever you say '' .
"`` Old Crip wasn't '' , retorted Cobb tartly ."
`` He'll know when you tell him .
But I want this to sink in awhile .
`` Pat had never pretended to give advice in such affairs .
"`` You're the doctor '' , he returned with a smile ."
"`` You don't have to tell me '' , flashed Cobb ."
"Pat let him go , following more leisurely ."
How much of an accident could that be '' ? ?
but on the range gunfire had a meaning .
"Hauling up , Russ listened carefully ."
He tightened up in a twinkling .
What did it mean ? ?
He knew now what he was up against .
`` Over this way ! !
He ain't gone far '' ! !
A harsh cry floated to him across the brush .
The would-be assassin had his position figured pretty close .
"Dismounting , Russ looked about hastily ."
Toward the west this depression led toward a draw .
A slug had torn half of his stirrup-guard away .
Another snarled close overhead .
`` Jumping Jerusalem ! !
Let's get out of here '' ! !
The long minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless .
"Gradually the wash climbed upward , forcing him toward open range ."
Yet he must chance it .
And Sweeney Squadron put its first marks on the combat record .
Every plane that could fly was sent into the air .
Anything the enemy flew or floated was his target .
Each plane carried two five-hundred pound bombs .
No one had much to say .
The sky glowered down at them .
`` But this goddamn climate .
It's for carabao not airplanes '' .
`` We'll make out .
The pilots' heads looked ridiculously small .
Underneath him the sea was a dark and muddied gray .
He shivered in the warm cockpit .
The overcast was solid above him .
Greg pushed the radio button on his throttle .
"`` Todman , let's try to go under this stuff ."
Stay in close and we'll go up the valley '' .
The formation remained perfect .
`` Somebody beat us to it '' ! !
But Greg's area remained as placid as a Florida dawn .
The low clouds made bombing difficult .
The accuracy was deplorable .
"Mercifully , it was still open ."
Twelve o'clock level '' .
Greg's eyes flicked up from his instrument panel .
They were headed straight for each other on a collision course .
Friend or enemy ? ?
The same old question .
And only a few seconds to answer it .
`` Zeros '' ! !
"Todman said excitedly , and hopefully ."
And then he thought Todman might be right .
"If it were the enemy , tactically his position was correct ."
"In seconds , Greg made his decision ."
He pushed the radio button .
"`` Sweeney Blue , hit the deck ."
"Todman , you take the one on the left ."
I'll take the middle .
"Belton , the one on the right ."
Let's make sure first '' .
The opposing aircraft continued to come on .
They appeared to be the enemy .
Greg wished the Air Corps had continued to camouflage planes .
It was a box .
But they could turn and escape to the east .
Greg pushed the radio button again .
"`` Todman , drop your second element back ."
Now let's make sure they're Japs '' .
"`` Arm your guns , Sweeneys '' ."
"They're Japs '' , came a high-pitched voice ."
`` Greg to Sweeney Blue .
That's an order '' .
He moved the flights over against one wall .
`` They haven't seen us '' .
He hit the radio button .
"`` Now , Sweeneys , now ."
Let's take 'em home '' .
He hauled back on the stick and felt his cheeks sag .
"Perfect , he thought ."
He tightened his turn .
It was going to be dangerous .
Eight aircraft in this small box .
The enemy did not veer .
It did not seem possible that they hadn't been spotted .
Greg's fingers closed on the stick trigger .
The plane rumbled and slowed .
Six red lines etched their way into the gray and vanished .
As if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them .
Greg tightened his turn until the plane shuddered .
Luck was with him .
The Jap's propeller flew off in pieces .
A large piece of engine cowling vanished .
It was all Greg had time to see .
His speed was dropping rapidly .
"Wingman , stay clear , he prayed ."
He fought the panic of vertigo .
He had no idea which was up and which was down .
He held the controls where they had been .
His air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out .
Then I saw the father's head slightly turn ; ;
gauche rainbow shapes replaced the poignant ovals of gold .
"`` Onleh one thiihng '' , Mrs. Roebuck continued ."
How far I knew will shortly become apparent .
Johnson never would have believed she had a son that age .
"`` No , I don't '' , Johnson said ."
"`` I'm a good Baptist , and drinking ''"
"`` Get in , buddies ."
"it flopped down , sprang back up and gouged my shin ."
The truck was hurtling forward .
Maybe I would beat old Herry to Siberia after all .
Whatever satisfaction that might offer .
Something pulled my leg .
"I drew back , drawing back my foot for a kick ."
`` Wanna beer '' ? ?
Did I want a beer ? ?
Did an anteater want ants ? ?
"`` Bueno , amigo ."
I wouldn't have known the difference .
"We were off the road , gleaming barbed wire pulling taut ."
Prairie dogs were popping up and popping down .
This time no wire came whipping into the truck .
We were back on the road .
I regained my squatting position behind the truck cab's rear window .
`` That was Tee-wah I was talking .
`` Drink your beer '' .
The beer foamed furiously .
I bobbed my head each time it appeared .
"A big car was approaching , its chrome teeth grinning ."
"Beyond it the gray road stretched a long , long way ."
I tossed the bottle .
On unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash .
`` Aye-yah-ah-ah '' ! !
The car was approaching fast .
There was no time to pick out a penny ; ;
Brakes shrieked behind us .
I quickly turned around and began to drink .
But the Indian was jabbing another bottle toward Johnson .
"She sat quietly , staring at me from the wide eyes ."
And what eyes they were .
"Big and dark , a melting , golden brown ."
"Eyes like hot honey , eyes that sizzled ."
Shall I go on '' ? ?
It was her first smile .
But worth waiting for .
"`` But one word at a time , O.K. '' ? ?"
"Would you like a drink , or coffee '' ? ?"
"`` No , thanks '' ."
She was wearing nothing beneath the coat .
`` I forgot '' ! !
"`` Oh , do forgive me ."
I'm sorry '' ! !
`` I forgive '' --
`` That's what started all the trouble in the first place .
"Oh , dear , I'm all unstrung '' ."
"`` You and me both , dear ."
Haven't we haven't I seen you .
"I mean , surely we've '' --"
`` I've done several filmed commercials for '' --
Then it hit me .
`` Zing '' ! !
"`` Why , yes ."
And you recognized me '' ? ?
"`` Yes , indeed ."
"What's your name , anyway ? ?"
"Ah , you were splendid '' ."
I sat by her on the divan .
In a waterfall and all that '' .
`` That's the last one we did .
That was a fun one '' .
"It was fun for me , all right ."
I mean : Is advertising honest ? ?
`` It depends on who does it .
I never wear anything at all .
"It wouldn't -- wouldn't seem fair , somehow '' ."
`` I couldn't agree with you more '' .
About the murder '' .
"Oh , yeah '' , I said ."
`` Tell me about the murder '' .
even to clean men and boys .
"He wanted a few stills for magazine ads , he said ."
And he didn't have any clothes on '' .
`` He didn't '' ! !
"`` Yes , he didn't ."
"Did , I mean '' ."
"Anyway , it was evident what he had in mind '' ."
"`` You got away , didn't you '' ? ?"
`` I didn't know .
I wouldn't have the stuff in the house .
But I'm pleased to hear '' --
`` So I just scooted out of his clutches .
"`` A man was holding onto Lou , holding him up ."
There's a walk there that goes out to Quebec Drive .
`` You know who the other man was '' ? ?
"`` No , I never did see his face ."
But I'm sure the other one was Lou '' .
Or at least not to Joyce .
"`` And I so want the part '' , she said ."
I could show what I can do '' .
Joyce squirmed a little on the divan .
"`` I'm starting to itch '' , she said ."
`` Itch '' ? ?
"`` Yes , I'm still all covered with that soap ."
"Mmmm , it sure itches '' ."
"`` Oh , I'd love to '' ."
That always relaxes me .
Doesn't it you '' ? ?
`` Only when I do it '' .
I shook my head .
"`` Soak as long as you want , Joyce ."
"So you'll have everything all to yourself , doggone ''"
I looked at my watch .
"Time to go , I supposed ."
"`` Well , goodbye '' , I said ."
You'd better hurry '' .
"`` Oh , you can count on that '' ."
`` Don't hurry too much .
I'll be soaking for at least half an hour '' .
That was all she said .
She wouldn't be taking a cold shower .
Lights blazed in the big house and surrounding grounds .
`` How'd you hear about this one '' ? ?
"I grinned , but ignored the question ."
He didn't push it ; ;
He filled me in .
`` What were they doing here '' ? ?
What is the gunk '' ? ?
`` How would I know ? ?
"I said , `` O.K. , so now only Blake knows ."
"How's it strike you , foul or fair '' ? ?"
`` Can't say yet .
"Accident , murder , suicide -- take your pick '' ."
`` I'll pick murder .
Anything else '' ? ?
those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick .
The arrangement turned out to be excellent .
She looked more like twenty-five or six .
It was really a May and December combination .
"the calf was magnificent , the ankle perfect ."
That she impressed me instantly was obvious ; ;
She was standing with her back to the glass door .
You have probably experienced this .
Why she married him I do not know .
some women with father fixations do .
his bride opened the store .
`` He will not always be indisposed '' .
I was thinking about that .
How will we work it out '' ? ?
"`` I don't know '' , she said ."
`` You're the man .
You figure it out .
`` I guess we both felt it '' .
"`` I guess so '' , she said ."
`` But now what '' ? ?
"`` I know what we can do '' , I said ."
`` Tell him I made a pass at you '' .
She raised a protesting hand with a startled air .
`` What are you trying to do ? ?
Get thrown out ? ?
Tomorrow Mardi Gras opens officially .
There will be romance and flirtation .
You are both the same size .
`` But you '' -- she began .
`` Don't worry about me .
It will turn out all right '' .
"`` I don't understand '' , she insisted ."
`` Are you trying to cut your throat '' ? ?
I must say the figure was well made up .
I suspected why he brought it along .
"You get a good , loyal husband -- smack ! !"
You should -- smack ! !
-- be ashamed of yourself .
He had better write a postcard to Walter .
"Nicolas called on his muse , a line came back :"
His hand was large and square and heavily tanned .
The voice crying in him was the voice of guilt .
His four weeks in Italy had turned into nearer three months .
He had returned to the pension a week ago .
He was determined to spend an industrious summer .
"Well , maybe Manas wouldn't call ."
"But Nicolas , too , was being interrupted , that morning ."
Should she wake him ? ?
She didn't have the heart .
She was just not able to break the spell .
Mary Jane Lerner knew none of this .
The next day he was gone .
`` How like him '' ! !
Mary Jane had smilingly said .
She set down her suitcase .
Should she wake him ? ?
The sun grew hotter as it approached the midday .
His nose was tickled .
He blew his nose expertly between his fingers .
"He belched , he stretched ."
"Mary Jane got up , quietly , and walked away ."
She had retreated to this world .
Families are very interesting .
"Nevertheless , there is no bath ."
And then we shall see .
'' ( The Grafin was partial to the word shall .
Shall we allow her not to have a bath ? ?
"Actually , she is a sad beauty , I believe ."
You shall see her at dinner '' .
Rather erotically he listened to the bath water running ; ;
"Before dinner , he shaved for the second time that day ."
"A thing he did not like doing , generally ."
Mary Jane had made very little effort .
The result was grace and modesty .
Meredith began falling in love .
Soup : `` Only this morning '' ; ;
`` What a beautiful room .
Like as if it were built of books '' .
`` I think the maids tipple in the afternoon '' .
`` Those sweet girls ? ?
It tastes a little like poppyseed .
What's its name ? ?
) But he read on .
I can never pronounce it '' .
She repeated `` Eurydice '' .
The third time rather urgently .
But with her hand poem again .
They finished the small bottle of Steinhager .
"Kissing her he whispered , several times , `` Eurydice '' ."
The third time rather urgently .
Molten glare singed their eyelids an angry crimson ; ;
dust choked their throats and lay like acid in their lungs .
`` Hoa-whup '' ! !
The dust-thick saliva came from his mouth like balled cotton .
The burning air dried his sweat-soaked clothes in salt-edged patches .
He cleared his throat and wet his lips .
He unlashed the dipper and drew water from a barrel .
The water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste .
But it was water .
"Thank the Lord , they still had water ! !"
He cleansed his mouth with a small quantity .
He took a long but carefully controlled draught .
`` What happens when there's no more water '' ? ?
Her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal .
Her temper sparked like charcoal when it first lights up .
`` There must be some water under there '' .
`` And add fever to our troubles '' ? ?
"`` We can boil it '' , he said ."
`` The tires are rattling on the wheels now .
They'll roll off in another day .
There was no valley like this on your map .
You don't even know where we're headed '' .
"Somewhere , we'll hit a trail '' ."
His wide mouth compressed .
"In a way , he couldn't blame her ."
She had hated the whole idea before they started .
"Actually , she had hated him before she ever saw him ."
"But each mile westward , she had hated him the deeper ."
`` Don't try to be noble '' ! !
Her laugh was hard .
He darkened under his heavy burn .
His blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead .
"To his puzzlement , there suddenly was no haze ."
"He hollered hoarsely , `` Hang on '' ! !"
And goaded the oxen as he yelled .
He swung up over the wheel .
"`` You had better get inside '' , he warned her ."
But she sat on in stubborn silence .
The six-ton Conestoga began to whip and shake .
Their world turned black .
It was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence .
The cloudburst cut off abruptly .
The water level was higher than their hubs .
Only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored .
Clumps of brush rode down the ribbon .
"At least , the wheels dug in ."
His wife didn't give a sign she'd heard .
She was watching a tree ride wildly down that roiling current .
Somebody was riding the tree .
She did not call out .
They watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend .
The pale blob of the woman disappeared .
`` There's the one who's lucky '' ! !
The girl murmured harshly .
They were already swollen to bursting .
The oxen might as well enjoy it .
"A terrible , numbing sense of futility swept over him ."
He gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat .
Hope surged within him .
"Still , he felt better ."
A tight wagon meant so much .
Their jams and jellies had not suffered .
That's a good trunk .
If you want to get them aired ''
The lifeboats were stuck fast .
We couldn't budge them .
Heave on those ropes ; ;
the boat's come unstuck '' .
The Bonaventure was quivering and lurching like an old spavined mare .
`` That tub is going to explode all at once '' .
Already our leaky lifeboat was filled with five inches of water .
There were gigantic blisters and rope burns on our hands ; ;
our muscles were hot wires of pain .
Brassnose was strangely silent .
He then said something which struck a chord in my memory .
We'd be in real trouble then .
I'd rather keep bailing -- or sink '' .
He had been speaking of this archipelago :
`` I know something about Eromonga .
Let's hope we come to a safer place '' .
A half-hour passed ; ;
we had drifted closer .
I squinted at the looming shoreline .
A fine example of engineering in a primitive society .
"`` What is the scaffolding for , Brassnose '' ? ?"
He made a sound of despair deep in his throat .
We are thirsty and hungry ; ;
our sore and burned hands and arms need attention '' .
You are welcome to Eromonga .
My people await you on the shore .
"You shall have food , water and rest '' ."
I saw a dozen or so other outriggers moored there .
Some had been there for years ; ;
others still had whitened shreds of decayed flesh sticking to them .
There was one object which sickened yet fascinated me .
The body may have been two or three weeks' dead .
I looked with revulsion at the legs .
Many small bones protruded crazily from the shreds of flesh .
"`` This is our tultul , a jumping platform , aku ."
"Later , you shall know it better ."
Is it not well-made ? ?
We are very proud of it '' .
He looked as if he was going to keel over .
"Not so soon , anyway ."
The maku Frayne has inherited this strength from his grandfather '' .
This was the worst thing I could have said .
They despise males who brag of their strength ; ;
they destroy such men with their damned tests .
"You've ruined me , blast you '' ! !"
The women's faces had hardened after my statement .
"Besides , terror had sapped some of Frayne's vitality and will ."
Her name was L'Turu and she told me many things .
Karipo was something of a politician as well as a militarist .
`` All men went away from here .
Those who stayed had to pass tests .
"She cackled with mirth , showing the stumps of betel-stained teeth ."
"Come , I show you '' ."
Maybe to beat up on his squaw '' .
For a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless drivers softened .
"Maybe the Indian wasn't too much at fault , Ramey thought ."
He said to his partner .
`` You mean dream '' ? ?
Just see it '' .
`` You seen him yet '' ? ?
"Benson said , referring to the Indian ."
"`` He wasn't in the car '' , Ramey said ."
"`` You didn't go clear around '' , Benson said ."
She wore shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt .
`` What outfit does she drive for '' ? ?
"Seeing her caused a lurch in Ramey , a recognition ."
She might have been someone he had once loved .
How would you ever see her again ? ?
"The feeling subsided , it was only a small yearning ."
Their work was lonely .
`` What's she doing in this bunch '' ? ?
The girl looked around at the countryside .
The two drivers moved closer .
"`` What does he want , a spoon '' ? ?"
Benson said to Ramey .
The two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man .
"`` He's dead , isn't he '' ? ?"
He turned and bent over the body of the Indian .
There was nothing in particular on the man's face .
`` What's this '' ? ?
His words were mostly to himself .
There was a gentle concern in Benson's voice .
`` But what is it '' ? ?
The man said with a tone of impatience .
But what is it ? ?
The man had spoken only once .
"It was a straight , solid , once-in-a-lifetime shot ; ;"
He moaned and pulled the hand away .
Even yet there was no realization in his eyes .
He did not look around .
`` What happened '' ? ?
`` He's hurt '' ! !
The man on the ground began to move ; ;
"An incoherent , puzzled sound came from the red mouth ."
The girl looked around quickly at several of the people .
None of the crowd had stepped forward to help .
Then she saw Ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment .
"She said , her voice rising ."
Behind Ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers .
Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man .
"`` All right , step back '' ! !"
`` You all right '' ? ?
It was only then that he turned to look at Penny .
"But her hands were calm , now ."
"She's got guts , thought Keith ."
She's got more guts than any other woman in the world .
"Thank you , Keith '' ."
He smiled at her sincerity .
Seven years they'd been married .
But her beauty always surprised him anew .
Isn't that so '' ? ?
Penny lowered her eyes .
"`` The snake was beautiful , wasn't it '' ? ?"
Penny did not answer .
Keith was snarling now .
And he loves you because you're a beautiful woman .
"All of us , that is , except me ."
"Well , why don't you say something '' ? ?"
Penny would not rise to his mood .
Just as he knew that she had stopped loving him .
But Keith looked down more than up .
He knew how to shoot down Nazis .
"That was true , but only half the truth ."
He enjoyed the killing .
It took a long time before the British tipped the balance .
That was where he met Penny .
"Penny knew him better , on her part ."
"They don't go for bull-like muscle , as a rule ."
Keith was an eagle .
Penny and Keith had no romance .
No dates or hand-holding .
"This time , they had been lucky ."
"The Command post was underground , and well camouflaged ."
But there hadn't been enough time to build it for keeps .
This one was actually more of a `` near miss '' .
"That is , everyone but Keith and Penny ."
The bomb was a solitary one .
"The blast damaged , but did not destroy the room ."
"The chaplain married them , on the next day ."
"But to Keith's London-bred mind , such acreage sounded rather invincible ."
He couldn't stop killing .
"That was his true love , not Penny ."
This is a paradise for hunters .
The great black leopards .
But there are big rogues in both countries .
They came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools .
"Peacocks strutted across their path , preening ."
The German courteously indicated that Robinson should mount first .
So instead I come up '' .
`` Was it my equipment '' ? ?
`` Was it something went bad with the breathing '' ? ?
He stared stonily at the floor .
I've been that far half a dozen times .
So you turn around '' .
"`` No , it wasn't that '' , Rob said ."
A note of awe came into his voice .
"`` Pressure-happy '' , Artie said , and climbed in ."
"`` That's right '' , Robinson said ."
"`` I was expecting it , sure ."
You don't head back down again .
"Not me , anyway ."
Not right away '' .
Now he was going to show how much he knew .
"`` Our boy didn't chicken out , no sir ."
He ran into the rapture of the depths .
It makes the diver feel drunk '' .
"`` Anyway '' , Waddell went on ."
`` It's nothing to fool with .
It can kill you .
"`` Nobody's giving anything up '' , Robinson said ."
and yet like a child among adults .
I'm going down again '' .
`` That's my boy '' ! !
"`` Seven years ago , Commodore '' , Rob said impassively ."
"`` Excuse me '' , he said abruptly ."
went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him .
"`` Hi there , Schaffner '' , he had said ."
`` Can I make you one '' ? ?
"`` I do not drink so much , thank you '' ."
"Aloud he had said , making conversation :"
"`` Yes '' , Herr Schaffner had said ."
I like that kid '' .
"`` I agree , yes '' ."
"`` Well , no '' , Herr Schaffner said ."
Waddell turned to face him .
`` No '' ? ?
`` But that's what he told me .
"Why , that's his main reason for making the dive '' ."
`` What do you mean '' ? ?
"Waddell asked , frowning ."
`` Did you tell him all this '' ? ?
`` But surely you have misunderstood Mr. Roy .
"Never , never did I offer him the exclusive rights ."
He was most eager to make the dive ; ;
"of course , I was willing ."
But there was no definite agreement about business arrangements '' .
He started out the door .
`` One moment '' ! !
`` You intend to speak with Mr. Roy '' ? ?
`` What else '' ? ?
Mr. Roy is determined to make this dive .
Whatever you tell him he will dive .
I know this from my talks with him '' .
`` On the basis of the facts '' .
Waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk .
`` I will give Mr. Roy his due for this dive .
All tourists come to Florida .
He took a big swig of his drink .
"`` Yes '' , the German said ."
`` At least for South Florida '' .
I guess you're right '' .
the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America .
`` Join me in another '' ? ?
"`` Thank you '' , the German had said courteously ."
`` I do not drink so much '' .
Fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions .
"said a Hail Mary , slowly and with understanding ."
Make it come off all right .
And make my life different and better from this time on .
He crossed himself again and rose .
He felt a good deal less shaky .
"`` You know I know it '' , Robinson answered warily ."
"`` Well , I was a little bit confused ."
"Anyway , I wasn't down long enough to matter ."
`` I don't think you should go down again '' .
Early that day Matsuo saw a marine .
tomorrow : no surrender .
It was best to die fighting the marines .
What if the marines never came ? ?
His comrades were all dead .
He had no rice .
Then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide .
He sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk .
His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife .
Besides the belt he wore a loin cloth .
The marines let him advance .
Matsuo repeatedly choked down his own nausea .
He strained his hearing .
Cautious feet stepping on leafmold ; ;
faint creaking of belts and slings ; ;
whispers : he heard none of these .
"leaning sidewise on a tree trunk , he embraced it ."
Humiliation made Matsuo tremble .
The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound .
How stupid to give his position away .
The jungle did not retort .
The sitter remained seated hugging the tree .
It ended when he tumbled ; ;
"but jumping right up , he staggered in no particular direction ."
The pockets of his jacket bulged .
"In the hush that followed the echoes , Matsuo was tense ."
They could come on him now without difficulty .
Gradually he reached a conclusion .
Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out .
"Rifle leveled on the man , he made a rush ."
"around the hole , blood glistened in a little patch ."
One by one he tossed the objects aside .
Too bad the marine had no water .
From its holder he took his own canteen .
Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips .
The marine reached up a hand .
Matsuo shook his head .
`` None for you '' .
"The marine blinked , soon dropping his hand ."
`` You came well equipped to die '' .
Some odor made him lean over the man .
He sniffed and recognized it .
So that had been his difficulty .
`` Be a good turtle '' .
The smell of sake had freshened yesterday's events in his thoughts .
The marine shut his eyes .
"`` Are you a thrower of flame , marine '' ? ?"
"He waited in his squat , gripping the hair ."
Every so often he turned the knife .
Its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight .
The man had thrown the left hand over his eyes .
Now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle .
Matsuo shook his head .
At last he reached for the knife .
The marine yelled and flung the hand away .
Matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat ; ;
burned the other cheek ; ;
burned each hand when they came groping again .
"`` A small measure of payment , marine '' ."
"Matsuo walked toward his tree , once glancing back ."
The marine was still .
He would soon die .
He cupped his mouth and yelled .
Matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder .
"He aimed , but listened ."
`` Sake '' ? ?
The marine nodded vigorously .
"Matsuo laughed , slung the rifle ."
The marine was a winehead .
His superiors had said that all marines were depraved .
"Remembering his own thirst , Matsuo took out his water bottle ."
One swallow was all he would have ; ;
"he was very thirsty , but he must observe water discipline ."
"Popping upright , the marine waved both hands and shouted ."
Of course it was water he really craved ; ;
Matsuo shook his head .
He had no water for an enemy .
He capped the bottle and replaced it .
Before much longer the marine quieted down .
The upper part of his packet had stained dark .
"There is nothing for you '' , Matsuo said ."
I've nothing for you '' .
Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were .
He leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed .
The stranger ignored him .
`` Because I'm asking .
Most of the time I get what I ask for '' .
Blue Throat winked at his six cronies .
"`` The kid has no manners , boys ."
Shall we teach him some '' ? ?
"The Colt roared twice and two men dropped , writhing ."
A third shot doused the light .
And I aim to have it '' .
"`` OK , Tilghman , I'm quitting '' ."
"`` And me '' , said another Blue Throat henchman ."
Somebody brought a light .
I've come for Pat Conyers' body '' .
Blue Throat won't stand for this .
He'll shoot up the town '' .
The prediction was correct .
Billy Tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle .
Several were firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived .
He sized up the situation and shook his head .
Billy returned with six sticks of dynamite .
Here he couldn't be seen by Blue Throat and his gang .
Billy Tilghman did just that .
It was the abrupt end of Blue Throat's dictatorship in Petrie .
Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang .
"`` Wait here , Neal '' , said Tilghman ."
"`` Hello , Ed '' , said Tilghman ."
The rancher grunted an acknowledgement but didn't move .
Tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire .
"Thinking fast , Tilghman never hesitated for one instant ."
`` Just dropped in to ask where Jed Hawkins lives .
Can't seem to locate landmarks in this snow '' .
The rancher was trembling .
He wouldn't look Tilghman in the face .
`` Jed's homestead is on the south bank '' .
Leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to Neal Brown .
"`` Don't say or do anything '' , he said softly ."
That place is crawling with Bill Doolin and his gang '' .
We'll let him go '' .
Then he would run to the toilet behind the house .
The first two or three days they went home early .
"All , that is , except Jack ."
He thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating .
then he slowed to a walk .
The vision became even stronger now .
"`` I'll get her yet '' , he muttered to himself ."
`` I've got to get her '' .
"`` What's the matter , honey '' ? ?"
`` Aren't you hungry '' ? ?
He felt a little sick at his stomach .
`` Are you sick '' ? ?
"`` No '' , he said ."
`` I'll be all right .
I guess it's this hot weather '' .
`` Don't you play hard today then .
"`` OK. , I won't play hard '' , he promised ."
"`` Whaddya say , boy '' ? ?"
"Charles said , grinning , showing his huge yellow teeth ."
`` You know what I done last night '' ? ?
A nude imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack's mind .
His heart beat faster .
`` How'd you do it '' ? ?
`` Jist like that '' ? ?
`` I never heard that '' .
`` It's all over Branchville .
`` Let's go inside '' .
"`` No , not now '' , said the teacher ."
`` Maybe at dinner time .
Come inside now '' .
The children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse .
Jack watched Miss Langford all morning .
`` Why ain't you playin' ball '' ? ?
Presently she came out of the schoolhouse .
They played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap .
I didn't mean to pull so hard '' .
`` It was my fault '' .
"`` Thank you '' , she said , dusting herself off ."
One of the little girls said .
`` No more today .
Maybe some other day '' .
"`` Oh , shucks '' , the girl said ."
`` I don't believe I'll play any more neither '' .
To his surprise his plan worked perfectly .
He scarcely saw them .
It is almost time for and calinda to begin '' .
He chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start .
The dance was of Haitian origin .
Delphine was a pace-setter in high society .
"`` What is your name , boy ? ?"
Come a bit closer .
"I won't bite , you know '' ."
Then he smiled shyly .
"`` My name is Dandy Brandon , missy ."
I belong to Master Alexander Prieur '' .
"You look quite strong and healthy to me , Dandy '' ."
Mrs. Lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage .
Prieur has gout and depends on Louis' pills and bleedings .
One less shouldn't matter to him '' .
"`` Another youth , Madame '' ? ?"
The coachman said softly .
"`` This one is a tender chicken , oui ? ?"
"Such delicate beauty , such fine flesh ."
It will rip and shred easily for Madame '' .
"`` Be quiet , Devol ! !"
You are forgetting your place '' .
The tall coachman walked off briskly in search of Alexander Prieur .
"`` Another young man , my dear ? ?"
"`` Dandy is to be our house guest , Louis ."
"`` Quite so , my dear ."
His room will be ready shortly '' .
But he liked the smell of Delphine's perfume .
"Also , he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony ."
His pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition .
These were the last words he ever uttered .
The ball broke up in confusion .
Guests stared with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made speedy departures .
But at the coroner's inquest Delphine told a forthright story .
Such a pitiful end '' ! !
The bleeding girl was tiring fast ; ;
"There ain't nobody askin' for your ticket stub , neither '' ."
Ever since all that .
Out and out and never to return again .
That was the day it ended .
"The freight car was cold , early in the morning ."
"Hot , that was the word , hot ! !"
"A poet , yet ! !"
"`` We made it , Cappy '' , the chick said ."
`` Ah-ah '' ! !
`` None of that .
We run a respectable house here '' .
He held the black plastic kazoo lightly .
`` That crap is softer over here '' .
"The girl smiled , and started forward ."
We don't know this guy '' .
This guy was strictly from Outsville .
`` What is with this vow jazz '' ? ?
"Feathertop inquired , lounging against the freight's vibrating wall ."
"`` We -- we eloped '' , Cappy said ."
His head came up and he said it defiantly .
"`` Well , congratulations '' ."
Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand .
These two were going to be easy pickins .
That was gonna be fun collecting ! !
But not just yet .
Feathertop was a connoisseur .
He liked to savor his meat before he tasted it .
He grinned at them wolfishly .
`` And you know -- you're right '' ! !
Feathertop aimed a finger at him .
He's a nice guy '' .
He cleared his throat ; ;
"He had it all doped , of course ."
Hmm -- diddle ! !
`` Where from '' ? ?
I been riding train for a ways now '' .
Ernie found it immensely funny .
"The boy scowled at him , and the girl looked shocked ."
She snapped at him .
`` I only said I was hungry .
We haven't had anything to eat all day '' .
"`` Whyn't ya say so , fellow travelers ! !"
"Why , we got dinner right here ."
Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag .
"`` Yeah , but what're we gonna eat ? ?"
"`` Hot dogs , man ."
Almost immediately they began to sizzle .
He looked up and grinned .
"`` A Kroger's self-serve '' , he explained ."
`` I self-served '' .
"Nice kid , Ernie thought , too bad ."
He didn't want us to get married .
So we ran away '' .
`` Why didn't he want you to get hitched '' ? ?
This time even she did not answer .
"She looked down at her hands , too ."
It was my fault '' .
Cappy's head came around sharply .
It was all my fault .
Ernie's eyebrows went up .
`` What's the matter '' ? ?
Cappy raged at himself .
"`` Oh he was stupid , her old man ! !"
This was a slightly different matter .
"He remembered Midge , and the child ."
But these kids weren't like him .
"He thought , Pull out of it , old son ."
These are just another couple of characters to roll .
"What they got , you get ."
Now forget all this other .
`` Wanna drink '' ? ?
Now that you offer '' .
The answer came from the open door of the boxcar .
Ernie stared at the man .
"Road gang , Ernie thought ."
"`` You gonna give me a drink , fella '' ? ?"
Ernie hesitated a moment .
This character could break him in half .
The kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump ! !
And carried him backward in a footballer's tackle .
The blade came out with a snick ! !
Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white .
Do something '' ! !
They neither liked nor disliked the Old Man .
The Old Man was unimportant .
Or the bay of female dogs in heat .
"They never called him by name , although he had one ."
but here he was just Signore or the Old Man .
Youth obeyed when commanded .
But the past was dead here as the present was dead .
Once the Old Man had had a wife .
"And once she , too , ignored him ."
"`` No , no ."
"`` Eh , Torino ! !"
She gave herself fancy airs ! !
They had slapped their thighs .
`` Henh '' ! !
`` Puttana '' ! !
His voice had not commanded her to stop .
It had not questioned why .
( He was never without that dog .
To him they were one and the same .
Sameness lined the streets with two-story houses the color of ash .
The hedge reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it .
Only one house on the street had no lawn before it .
That was Bartoli's shop .
Did the Old Man remember them there ? ?
The Old Man silently fed upon these streets .
"They kept him alive , waiting ."
He was holding out for something .
He was determined to hold out .
neither did he care that Aunt Rose provided for him .
He would not carry a brief case .
Nor would he work at all .
He could do that when he would be a man .
"`` Hey , Laura '' ! !"
He called to his sister on the porch above the steps .
She was only ten months older than he .
Laura did not answer him .
Her face showed no sign of having heard Pompeii .
He was never sure they fully took him in .
"Pompeii called again , `` Laura '' ! !"
"`` Christ sake , goat , git '' ! !"
But the goat would not .
"`` You're boiling milk , ain't you '' ? ?"
Above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud .
Its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane .
But the boy could see only the goat's belly .
Time enough to give up his soul .
Little Anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery .
She stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food ; ;
Worry had a great deal to do with it ; ;
"`` I should think so '' , Eugenia said ."
"`` Well , let's see ."
Let's make a list of your assets '' .
`` What else '' ? ?
`` Every woman in the block has tried that '' .
"`` What about a tea room , then ? ?"
`` It's too elaborate .
"She said , `` Oh Eugenia , I wish ''"
`` What '' ? ?
"`` I wish I had three wishes '' , Maggie said ."
`` All of them for you '' .
There weren't facilities to take care of them ; ;
there never had been a need felt for such facilities .
"Shivering , people talked and argued ; ;"
Something had to be done ; ;
Something had to be done .
They lived mainly in the kitchen ; ;
"`` You said a mouthful '' , Eugenia said grimly ."
`` Plenty of people are poor all their lives '' .
`` Plenty of people haven't our brains and talent '' .
`` Thrifty of her to use it up .
"Unusual in a case like this , but '' --"
`` You can joke ! !
Didn't you read it ? ?
She's married that tenant ! !
"`` I read it , yes ."
This ought to simplify Tolley's life '' .
Laban had more to say .
Tolley had gone to live in California .
"`` We will both go back , Laban '' ! !"
Kizzie turned to go inside .
The sun's right '' --
`` Pictures '' ? ?
`` What pictures '' ? ?
`` In Brace's room ! !
You told me to bring my camera .
I'm not going back '' --
`` Indeed you are ! !
Why should I want pictures of an empty room now ? ?
Tolley had no idea of marrying that sneaky little Jenny ! !
"`` Hurry , Frank ! !"
Tolley's going is my fault .
I drove him away .
"She was so beautiful , so valiant , so pitiable ."
`` I'll decide that when I get there .
"I was so cruel to Tolley , so unfair ."
But I'll be fair now ! !
"He is coming back , isn't he , Frank '' ? ?"
"Yes , oh yes ."
What else was there to say ? ?
`` Under the window in stormy weather
I marry this man and woman together .
Let none but Him who rules the thunder
Put this man and woman asunder '' .
Absolution for his lie ? ?
`` Why lacerate the -- congregation '' ? ?
Surely now his beloved son could rest in peace .
"But there were great satisfactions , even for a small man ."
`` To absent loved ones '' .
`` You could try .
I heard you '' ! !
"Her horse , rather ."
And what had happened ? ?
Gunny invariably tried to bite her .
"Nerves , Mr. Robards said , just a nip anyway ."
"Never , `` Quit that , you sor'l devil '' ! !"
She musn't annoy Gunny whose foal was due then too ! !
Human birth was no novelty to Mr. Robards .
"Rhyme 'em up cute -- Arcilla , Flotilla ''"
"`` Kezziah , for Miss Kizzie '' , he suggested ."
"Now she must be thinking of a boy-name , something special ."
Just wait till she saw the Mare's foal .
Handsomest colt in all Kentucky .
What about Royal Robards ? ?
'' She burst into tears .
Roy was deeply distressed .
He'd had no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been .
He had a good idea why not .
Doc Dunne and Miss Sis had come .
There was an idea .
She hoped they were well .
I'll see word gets round '' .
`` Don't you dare ! !
"`` See for yourself , Miss Zion ."
It won't take a minute '' .
He swung in through his own wide gateway .
She'll relish the sight of a friendly face .
"Miss Kiz won't care your comin' , will she '' ? ?"
"`` Why of course not '' , Zion said uncomfortably ."
Doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman .
Perhaps Doaty had guessed already and kept her counsel .
Mama was vulnerable ; ;
"But I would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta ."
"She turned on her side , finding the idea oppressive ."
Impossible to imagine Adelia feeling so about anyone .
"No temptation , no sin ."
"No temptation , no virtue ? ?"
A curious thought to end a curious night .
"`` Rummaging in the dew '' , said Rosa coldly ."
`` Go change your shoes before you turn around '' .
"Folly danced , eager for whatever lay beyond the door ."
"On an impulse , she turned back and said good morning ."
"`` Summer's been slow to come '' , he said ."
`` It's my dryin' out time '' .
He scowled at her flowers .
It's dryin' myself out that does it '' .
He regarded her with rising hope .
`` You'd like to hear how I go about it '' .
"`` It's nice of you '' , Henrietta said doubtfully ."
`` Y're welcome '' .
It rests the tissues '' .
He looked up at her sharply .
"`` Don't remember , do you '' ? ?"
"She said gently , `` Of course I remember you '' ."
"`` Not so well's I remember you '' , he said ."
`` Y're the young Blackwell woman .
Ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded man .
I know all about you '' .
"`` You do seem to '' , said Henrietta , impressed ."
Any harm in that '' ? ?
"`` Probably '' , said Henrietta dryly ."
He gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly .
She smiled vaguely at Henrietta and spoke to the old man .
"`` You've not had your breakfast yet , gran'dad '' ."
"`` Y'r dam' porridge is no breakfast '' , he said ."
`` Milk and sops '' ! !
`` He's got this idea about drying out ''
`` It ain't an idea '' ! !
"`` Come on , do ."
`` To the graveyard .
Who ain't '' ? ?
I've got a day's work to do .
"-- You'll be visiting Miss Doaty , Ma'am '' ? ?"
How much they knew about her ! !
Come on now '' .
Apparently they were of Caucasian blood .
They had white skins and blue eyes ; ;
Tommy Momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions .
She had been in Japan just one week .
Anywhere would be better than the land of her ancestors .
There was nothing wrong with her job .
Tommy had been assigned to the psychopathic ward .
But she suffered in her off-duty hours .
"When he saw Tommy sitting alone , the tinkling sound stopped ."
Probably off one of the carriers -- an aviator .
It was as if foreign duty implied and excused license ; ;
"`` Harro , girl-san '' ! !"
"He said , turning on what was meant to be charm ."
`` You catchee boy-furiendo ? ?
Maybe you likee date with me '' ? ?
`` I beg your pardon '' ! !
Tommy said out of her cold rage .
`` Oh -- I'm sorry ! !
"`` Oh , yes -- you had ideas '' ! !"
`` All wrong ones '' ! !
"`` Take off , fly-boy '' ! !"
`` Uh -- sorry '' ! !
"She felt like a fool , too ."
it wasn't this way in the hospital at San Diego .
"She looked around , self-consciously ."
"For a steak sandwich , or `` Kohi Futotsu '' ! !"
For one cup of coffee .
One was with a whitehaired and doting lieutenant commander ; ;
Seeing these did nothing for Tommy's mood .
"And so she was , and would remain ."
Tommy wouldn't know ; ;
"after coming to America , her parents had spoken only English ."
One thing was becoming increasingly sure .
She had been sent to the wrong place for duty .
Now there was raucous male singing from the Fleet Bar .
Eating while angry had given her a slight indigestion .
"Then , after a while , she went to her mirror ."
It was all true .
"In his opinion , Doc had not grown up ."
The lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief .
"`` Well , Doc , you old sonofabitch '' ! !"
"Whitey exclaimed , with true affection ."
`` Come over and have a drink .
We live down by the Base commissary .
Grab a taxi '' .
`` I've got to run an errand on the way .
See you in about an hour '' .
"`` Hi , Buzz '' , Owen said ."
Imagine a stag dinner with Toodle Williams '' .
He laughed and laughed .
Buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his victims rest .
"`` Yes '' , Owen called out ."
`` Yes '' ? ?
"Ahah , he thought , a lush divorcee at last ."
Probably saw me in the lobby .
She frowned at his green pajamas with the yellow moons .
`` How do you do '' ? ?
"She said , semi-professionally ."
`` Oh '' ? ?
`` Why is that '' ? ?
She apparently wasn't satisfied with his reaction .
"Smug , Owen thought , smug and sappy ."
"It gave her a lewd , winking effect ."
"She asked , winking wildly ."
`` They are a very difficult group of people '' .
She smiled in a sickly-tolerant fashion .
"`` You know , that's very interesting ."
"Forebearing , Owen kept his peace ."
What would happen next ? ?
`` How did you get by the desk '' ? ?
"`` Oh , I just come once a week ."
Every day I visit a different hotel .
I feel it's my duty .
I have the whole Pacific Northwest '' .
Mrs. Gertrude Parker drew back .
"`` That's hardly a Christian approach '' , she remonstrated ."
`` You're in the secular world '' .
`` I didn't say it was Christian .
I don't think you'll find many active Christian salesmen .
Not that religion isn't big business ; ;
Our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics '' .
It sounded silly ; ;
why go on ? ?
More people were passing ; ;
he had to find some way to close this impossible conversation .
`` Don't forget whiskey ; ;
it's such a big seller '' .
I have an appointment '' .
"`` I can imagine '' , she said ."
`` Probably down at the bar .
But what do you want to do about the lay-sisters ? ?
They must be freezing up there now .
Can't you help them '' ? ?
`` Leave a card or something .
I'll think it over '' .
"`` I have no card '' , she said bitterly ."
`` You haven't been listening to what I've been telling you .
he heard her knocking on another door .
It took him about fifteen minutes to calm himself ; ;
then he realized he was hungry .
the glisten of the Truckee River made a wide spangle .
"He felt suddenly elated , adventurous ."
With any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot .
The way was opening up ; ;
The Golden Calf was dimly lit with shaded neon .
She sighed a dirty word and left .
`` You can't build on your hit-and-miss five-seventeen '' .
`` What are you playing '' ? ?
"`` I'm just logging '' , the cowboy explained ."
But roulette's not my game .
I'm always trying to find a breaking table in blackjack .
`` Nice to know you .
"`` Well , of course I do ."
"I'm with the Bar-H , pushing a horse called Sparky ."
He's a pinto and he photographs wonderfully '' .
His adventurous spirit had waned ; ;
He had no great prejudice against shills ; ;
it just seemed such a dry run .
There was no cash around ; ;
everyone was flipping silver dollars .
Owen found Buzz watching chuck-a-luck .
He was knocking down checks at faro '' .
"`` I'm allergic to Tahoe '' , Owen explained ."
`` Something about the pollen '' .
"`` Well , okay '' , Buzz said ."
`` We'll see you around later '' .
"`` How's your luck , honey '' ? ?"
A short platinum blonde in a bursting sun-suit addressed him .
I'll make them dance the tango .
We'll get it in a hurry and get it out '' .
`` Let's have a drink and discuss a merger '' .
"`` Sounds like real love '' , Owen said ."
`` It sort of brings a lump to my throat '' .
`` Named after the ballet .
Spencer shook his head .
"Alexander said , `` Answer me properly , Spencer '' ."
`` Very well '' .
Hostile glances were flashed at both Alexander and Gansevoort .
The two met in the Captain's cabin .
"`` What is the next step , Captain '' ? ?"
"`` More arrests , I fear '' ."
"`` Cromwell , of course ."
He is the oldest and most experienced of the lot .
Somehow he talked Spencer into letting him use another name '' .
`` Have him come in '' .
"`` Where did you gather all this information , Heiser ? ?"
Adrien Deslonde hastened to Alexander's side .
"I swear it , sir '' ."
"Wales said , `` Of course they would ."
We are going to be rushed and murdered '' .
"`` That is extravagant language , Mr. Wales ."
The instinct of discipline has been lost .
Anything is possible when anarchy has the upper hand '' .
`` We ourselves must stand sentinel '' .
"`` Under arms day and night , watch and watch about ."
Where had he failed ? ?
How had he failed ? ?
It was given or it was not given .
Another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist .
It was for love that he had served the Navy .
Now the hope was gone .
"Only Cromwell , the giant boatswain , was mild-mannered and respectful ."
"`` Are you , Cromwell '' ? ?"
"`` Yes , sir ."
"`` No , Cromwell , I did not find your name ."
You were careful about that '' .
"He said , `` Cromwell is telling you the truth ."
He is innocent '' .
Alexander shifted his gaze to Spencer .
Alexander knew Spencer too well to think him naive or thick-skulled .
This tragic lad had forged his own shackles .
He was your constant companion '' .
The hazel eyes met Alexander's .
`` I tell you he is innocent '' .
I have nothing to gain by defending Cromwell '' .
"`` Nothing to lose , either , Spencer '' ."
His eyes went back to contemplation of the sea .
"`` I am innocent , Captain '' , Cromwell said again ."
The boatswain was as guilty as any .
Bits of trash lay in the roadway .
The air smelled warmish and foul .
I was suddenly conscious of my bare arms .
Rachel had seen me watching the young man .
Like the ones you will see now '' .
She led me into a twisting side alley .
Rachel said that schools and synagogues occupied most of the buildings .
Rachel talked to him .
His toes pointed out toward the walls .
His black beard dripped down over the front of his coat .
One white hand poised a stick above his desk .
Rapping the stick against the desk .
The boys were tiny .
The guttural language from the ghetto stopped .
His tightly curled paot hung down to his narrow shoulders .
His head barely rose above the table .
I stared at him for a long time .
He did not return my interest .
The tapping defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake .
His body pitched back and forth on the bench .
His front teeth were missing .
I shuddered and backed out of the room .
We walked down the cool hall silently .
"`` All day '' , she said ."
I rubbed my hands together .
They had turned numb and prickly in the classroom .
He glanced down into his beard and muttered something in Yiddish .
"Rachel said , `` He asks for money '' ."
She passed by him .
I didn't look at him .
I grinned at Rachel .
`` Does this bother you '' ? ?
She smiled to herself .
`` Most of our Sabras think it's horrible .
You had to be stupid or crazy or immortal .
Her bright eyes were twinkling .
Your mother hated this way of life .
She wished to change much for the children here '' .
In this section '' ? ?
Rachel clicked her tongue behind her teeth .
"`` Here , nothing ."
She loved the children .
"She was a strange woman , your mother ."
Nothing was too impossible for her to do when she wanted .
She stayed here to work for Aliah .
Sometimes it was dangerous for her '' .
`` But she loved danger .
She took it with her wherever she went ; ;
She was most strange woman .
Ready to follow her impulse .
Here they did not need to be in ghettos .
I'd like to know that very much '' .
Rachel clasped her hands together and slowed her pace .
The soles of her sandals reported sharply on the cobblestones .
But she sighed and her face relaxed .
`` Trouble came into her life .
"She had good friends here , people who liked her ."
But she had to go out and hurt herself .
There was a man here in town .
She worked very hard .
He came with his son .
Yet he walked like a young man .
Often he was terribly despondent and talked to no one .
"All his family was dead , except for his son ."
She ran from a little group of us .
"We were sitting together , talking ."
It was silent in the stone alley .
No one saw her except the man Reuveni '' .
"`` Yes '' , I said ."
`` I know him '' .
"Rachel gave me a direct , bright-eyed look ."
He said she would only hurt herself .
He complained to me once that I must talk to her .
She came to me one day .
She was pale and skinny ; ;
she was terribly alone .
He would never let her harm herself again .
For one whole week he never let her stay alone .
She let him lead her around .
Reuveni took her with him wherever he went .
He did not let her talk to people ; ;
he did not let her choose her own food .
She was limp and beaten from her loss ; ;
she did not care .
`` And I'll take you with me '' .
The two of them against the world .
That had been how she imagined it .
But now the dream was over .
The big waking up had happened .
`` What did I imagine '' ? ?
And I'll take you with me .
He had taken her all right .
Wednesday nights after youth fellowship .
You could wish that .
"If it is love , you don't ."
And I'll take you with me .
You feel him every mile further away .
The mayor envisioned factories there .
"The bands were impatient , but they were the only ones ."
There was no lock because Herman didn't allow a lock .
A lock on the toilet would encourage malingering and primping .
Each of us had his own specialty besides .
I remember once I did a jacket for Magpie Press ; ;
"In the first place , it's static ; ;"
"in the second place , it doesn't look authentic ; ;"
McKenzie was as happy as a clam .
"`` That's authenticity '' , he said ."
"As for Donald , he actually sold paintings ."
none of us did .
I wanted to paint again .
I hadn't done a serious picture in almost a year .
Askington was a kind of goal I set myself ; ;
I had admired him long before I talked to him .
I had a long talk with him .
The fireplace had tiles made for Mrs. Monmouth by Picasso himself .
`` By yourself '' ? ?
He made a circle with his thumb and fingers .
"`` Painting isn't this big , you know ."
"It doesn't embrace only the artist , alone before his easel ."
"He threw his arms wide , his face shining ."
"The eye is all , inward or outward ."
`` What do you study '' ? ?
I was fascinated ; ;
just listening to him made me feel intelligent .
"`` I'm studying anatomy with Burns '' , he replied ."
`` Maybe you know him .
He teaches at the Manhattan School of Art '' .
Burns and I had not loved each other .
`` Osric Pendleton '' ? ?
He must be a million years old .
`` Not quite '' .
"`` He's about sixty , now ."
He even makes the city look like one of Thoreau's hangouts .
"`` You're missing the point '' , he said ."
`` He has the magical eye .
And he is a great man .
Contact with him is stimulating .
And that's the trouble with so many artists today .
That's one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation .
But look at us today ! !
A bunch of amateur dervishes ! !
He could certainly talk .
"In a way , Askington was right ."
`` Stimulating '' was the word for it .
"Partly , it was because Pendleton himself wasn't what I anticipated ."
"No , that isn't quite fair ."
Such a little thing to start with -- the car registration .
"`` Ida , where is the car license '' ? ?"
`` I can't find it in the glove compartment '' .
"`` Via '' , she was frowning ."
`` Why should Via have it '' ? ?
I didn't want to stir things up .
You know that '' .
She looked as if she were accusing me of some fraud .
I'll call her '' .
"`` No , thank you ."
I want nothing of Via's '' .
Why should this suddenly assail her ? ?
"`` What a fool I've been '' , she said quietly ."
"`` I knew all this , but I paid no attention ."
I don't even own the house I'm standing in .
So I went about my business .
"`` Don't bother , Ida '' , she said ."
"At last , I thought , she's recovering her spirits ."
But the next day -- Sunday .
"`` She's nowhere , nowhere '' ! !"
Then the telephoning began .
Why didn't that alarm me then ? ?
But it seemed not from what they were saying .
"That at last the vigilance , the will gives way ? ?"
I knew '' ! !
Everyone stared at me and drew back .
"Their eyes turned cold and accusing , even Via's ."
And they have never changed .
Was that what had given way in me ? ?
It is not their avoidance that rankles ; ;
She haunted me ; ;
`` It was nobody's fault .
She overplayed her hand '' .
`` What do you mean '' ? ?
"At rest with my darling Ellen , the first Mrs. Salter ."
Mr. Salter came home .
Via was in the parking lot when I went outside .
`` I had a rather small place of my own .
"`` Oh , I'd drink with newspaper people ."
"`` Well , what about you , Carla '' ? ?"
`` Me '' ? ?
"She asked , turning slowly ."
`` What about me '' ? ?
`` Did you make friends easily '' ? ?
"`` Umm , uhhu '' ."
How about it '' ? ?
`` Are your people still alive '' ? ?
so he could have something of her for himself .
`` You must have been good at history at school .
Where did you go to school '' ? ?
`` What is this '' ? ?
"She asked , turning suddenly ."
`` Don't you know all about me by this time ? ?
My name's Carla Caneli .
This is my town .
I sleep with you .
Why are you trying to worry me '' ? ?
`` I'm not trying to worry you '' .
"`` Well , all right then '' ."
`` What's the matter '' ? ?
"Nothing at all '' , he said quietly ."
`` Let's go out '' .
`` What's the matter with them '' ? ?
`` The heavy thick soles .
Look at them '' .
`` They're an expensive English shoe for walking around a lot .
I like them '' .
"`` Sam , no one around here wears such heavy soles ."
Can't you get another pair '' ? ?
`` What's the matter with it '' ? ?
"`` Oh , Sam ."
You look like a tweedy Englishman .
"But it was a hopeful sign , he told himself ."
Then they took a taxi to Trastevere .
Then they had dinner .
All evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself .
When they got home at midnight she was tired out .
She might like to take him to St. Peter's .
"`` Carla , wake up '' , he said shaking her ."
`` It's ten o'clock .
Aren't you going out to mass ? ?
You could take me to St. Peter's '' .
"`` Uhhu '' , she muttered ."
"`` Come on , you'll be late '' ."
It would be good for her .
Not his poor mother's fault .
Just figures out of a tribal folklore .
It was too bad he wasn't a Catholic himself .
"It was the times , he was sure ."
It was all too wearying .
There's so little to do '' .
`` Why not '' ? ?
`` I'm not good at that kind of thing '' .
`` This afternoon let's take an air with them .
`` I am what I am .
I can't help it '' .
"Her words remained with him , worrying him for hours ."
He didn't know how she would behave with other people .
"`` Ciao , '' and put out her hand ."
And they sat down and began their little coffee party .
The Ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee .
Had Sam ever lived in a boxcar ? ?
She wanted to know .
Regretfully Sam explained that he had no experience with boxcars .
But very mystical too .
It was said that he had had a vision .
"No , he was indeed a saint now ."
There was a certain discontent among the cardinals .
Jobs would be lost and new faces would become prominent .
Did Signor Raymond understand ? ?
"And Carla , watching in wonder , turned to Sam ."
`` It means so much to her .
"He cried out to her , his back turned ."
But she heard him go .
`` I shall call your father ! !
And it was not Pile of Clouds she meant .
"I will tell you to go , not begging ."
Telling you '' ! !
`` They do not have to face battle .
I will not let your evil in .
I will simply kill you first .
Now go '' ! !
They picked up sticks and hurled them at the girl .
`` Go back to your lodges '' ! !
`` A pack of dogs makes less noise '' ! !
And Early Spring seized the whip and said :
`` Get into your hovel '' ! !
`` What worrisome thing happens ? ?
I thought I dreamed of wolves fighting '' .
"She said , `` There is nothing that concerns you here ."
Lie back and go to sleep .
But do not dream .
Do not let the wicked spirits enter your brain '' .
"He sank back , sighing , and was soon asleep again ."
They all know your foolish name '' ! !
The sounds of an animal in rage and despair .
`` Did you follow me to see my shame ? ?
Do you hear the anger of the whip's whine '' ? ?
He amused the young men who had been silent long enough .
They came out and held their games and races .
It was they who held the future in their hands .
Then again they would stand in circles making other preparations .
"And the suspicious , envenomed eyes of Pile of Clouds ."
He felt so much like laughing ; ;
He and Sarpsis planned a great parade with the young men .
They mounted their horses and rode off into the hills .
The sounds from the quarry began to pulse in her ears .
"She stood , once more listening ."
She had never been here at this hour .
She had accomplished a miracle .
This was her place .
The hour couldn't change it .
Only -- only -- her thoughts were a little strange .
They were becoming confused .
"`` Hello , Julie , how are you '' ? ?"
"I wish I were older or younger , Julia Bentley thought ."
I wish so much someone loved me .
She had vanished ; ;
he must have slept again .
This room was like a prison .
He would not be indebted to Sam ! !
His fingers fumbled across the bandages .
They had left both of his eyes uncovered .
He was walking across to the bathroom .
He recognized his jacket and trousers .
The fabric was dark ; ;
the stains weren't too apparent ; ;
Sam would be amazed to find him gone .
Millie would have to understand .
She must have put his clothes in the closet .
He was on the verge of tears .
At least Alex had told him he wasn't dying .
Perhaps George Rawlings would be better off dead .
What time was it ? ?
He peered at his wristwatch .
"Strange , it was still running ."
A quarter to seven .
He was kneeling to tie his shoelaces .
His fingers felt absurdly thick and clumsy .
He barely knew himself .
"The surface , however , was perfectly white ."
He was drinking another glass of water .
It was after seven o'clock .
Who would take over ? ?
He entered the hallway .
He was actually walking down the stairs .
"`` Father , is that you '' ? ?"
The voice issued from the cavern of the hall below .
George did not reply .
"`` Is that you , Father ? ?"
Who's there '' ? ?
For a moment he felt like a thief discovered .
Then Julia appeared under the arch leading to the dining room .
She stood gazing at him .
`` Uncle George '' ! !
He was trying to smile at her .
"You shouldn't be up , should you '' ? ?"
"`` I -- I was just leaving here , Julie ."
Just about to call a taxi '' .
She was wearing some sort of gray blazer .
"She seemed overly tall , her brow knitted in concern ."
`` I'm about to leave myself .
I'll drop you off '' .
`` You're leaving '' ? ?
"`` I'm going back to school '' , she answered ."
`` Pietro's driving me .
I'm just finishing breakfast .
But have you told Mother you were going '' ? ?
"I just don't want anyone disturbed , Julie ."
"It's quite a big one '' , he added ."
Or maybe a drink '' ? ?
He tried to see her face more clearly .
`` I'll just wait for you here '' .
`` I have to say good-bye upstairs .
I won't be long '' .
`` Not to anyone '' ? ?
`` No -- please .
`` I'll call your mother as soon as I get home .
It'll be so much easier '' .
`` All right '' She was staring at him .
"`` I'm fine , Julie ."
"Please , you just go ahead '' ."
He could feel a pulse pounding against the bandages .
"I wouldn't have the strength to answer , he thought ."
Maybe I couldn't have called a taxi .
He could hear the footsteps overhead .
"He saw the suitcase , which Julia was holding ."
"`` I'll take that , Julie -- for you '' ."
"`` Oh no '' , she said ."
`` I can manage '' .
She went ahead of him .
Outside the Lincoln was parked .
He could hardly believe he was getting in .
but that didn't matter .
yet her inflection seemed forced or rehearsed .
He could not stop to analyze .
He had never felt particularly close to her .
He took her hand .
That's in the opposite direction '' .
"`` I wish I did '' , he responded ."
`` Forget we ever knew what '' ? ?
"`` Oh , just sort of everything in general '' ."
She said nothing until Pietro had slackened their pace .
`` Does it '' ? ?
"`` Yes , perhaps ."
"I'm supposed to joke about things , aren't I ? ?"
But sometimes life can be rather a disappointing business '' .
His voice seemed thick and purposeless .
He relinquished her hand .
He could see the stone building where he lived .
Just a few more steps .
Abruptly he reached into his pocket .
"Yes , there was the key ."
For a moment he smiled .
"`` Yes , Julie dear ."
You've done me the greatest possible service .
By myself I'll be fine '' .
`` Take care of yourself then '' .
Don't work too hard '' .
It was an automatic phrase ; ;
as he crossed through the courtyard he regretted it .
He should have discovered a more tender farewell .
"Someone shouted at him , `` Well ! !"
Will you look at George Rawlings ! !
What happened to you '' ? ?
"`` I bumped into a door handle '' , George said ."
George walked steadily ahead into his entry .
His bandages seemed on fire .
In the kitchenette the raw whiskey made him gasp .
"`` No , Millie , I'm home ."
"No , really , right as rain ."
Tell Sam not to worry about the car .
I'll get it hauled away .
"No , please -- no visit today -- I'll be asleep ."
That upsets me more than anything .
There was one more call to make .
"`` Joan , did I wake you '' ? ?"
"`` Yes , I thought you'd probably be up ."
"Look , sweetheart , some fool was ."
Happened to be driving somewhat intoxicated last night .
Too bad a jury isn't involved .
I might struggle in for a jury .
I'd win hands down .
But I thought maybe Tony Elliott could pinch-hit for me .
He's got all the facts .
"No , darling I'd rather you didn't come out '' ."
A smile pulled at the lower strip of adhesive tape .
`` Don't even send flowers .
I'll see you Wednesday .
`` I'll take you out to dinner .
He had put down the receiver .
A strange relationship between Joan Fulbright and himself .
Who knew about it ? ?
She had two tiny rooms on the second floor .
"She was a clever girl , a most efficient secretary ."
`` They make us conformists look good '' .
`` That's a peculiar way to think '' .
"She's a year older than I am , Lucy told herself ."
`` I love you .
Susan ready '' ? ?
"Obviously , Susan was not ."
"she always packed for a lifetime , just in case ."
Every doll in the house must be going with her '' .
`` She'd better step on it .
It's a long way to Websterville '' .
"Jim's fine young face was an expressive one , too ; ;"
"as he looked at her , it registered anxiety ."
"`` You know '' , he said ."
`` Myra wanted me to thank you for taking Cathy .
Lucy did not believe him ; ;
Jim had put the thanks in his sister's mouth .
`` She should have told me herself .
And will it be only a couple of weeks ? ?
Remember what happened the last time '' ? ?
`` That was an awfully long two weeks '' .
"You'll see , Myra's settling down '' ."
`` It depends on the widow '' .
Lucy had an idea that Myra loved it .
It was not that she disliked Cathy .
"The youngster drew her , troubled her depths ; ;"
"But Cathy was Myra's responsibility , not hers ."
Myra loved big cities ; ;
Lucy knew her too well to find it impossible .
`` That's a horrible thing to accuse her of '' ! !
Get moving '' ! !
A startled piping sound returned .
"`` Don't yell at Susan '' , Lucy said ."
Jim turned back from the stairway and looked at her .
"`` Please '' , he said ."
Let's stay friends '' .
"But they weren't just friends , Lucy thought ; ;"
Lucy was sick of it .
Susan looked like an overwhelmed baby nurse ; ;
her arms were straining with a burden of dolls .
"`` I'm ready '' , she announced ."
`` Do you need that big bundle '' ? ?
`` All that junk '' ? ?
"`` Your father didn't mean it , Susan '' ."
"She gave Jim a quick , shape-up look of warning ."
`` She'll take every one of them '' .
"there ought to be a limit to sharing , too ."
the last one had been a Lilliputian war .
She turned and began to walk toward the house .
The handsome bird was solitary ; ;
"its mate must be at home , silently guarding their nest ."
"She had better stay there , Lucy thought ; ;"
the sly female cowbirds took instant advantage of nests without sentinels .
"Well , Lucy ? ?"
"She said to herself , abandoning the cardinals and the cowbirds ."
She had a day of things to do ; ;
"among them , she had to prepare the guest room ."
How long would it be occupied ? ?
"She wondered , with a baffled feeling of helplessness ."
As long as the unscrupulous Myra chose ? ?
"`` Websterville Junction calling '' , she said ."
`` I just thought I'd let you know .
I'd have phoned sooner but I've been busy '' .
`` I can imagine '' ! !
Susan was an active character ; ;
Lucy drew out the chair and sat down ; ;
`` How was Cathy '' ? ?
But Myra was the merriest widow I ever saw '' .
`` I've been fixing up the guest room for Cathy '' .
"Puzzled , Lucy stared at the flowered wallpaper ; ;"
her mother was forthright ; ;
she was not usually given to mysterious silences .
`` You mean once Myra gets to Paris '' ? ?
"Shocked speechless , Lucy sat there ."
'' Then it was no bogey she had dreamed up ; ;
it was only too true .
`` That does it '' ! !
`` I'll keep Cathy for two weeks .
Her hand tightened on the receiver .
`` And that's what I'm going to tell Jim '' .
She's not going to get away with it .
The child's thin legs were plodding .
"Unlike Susan , she was traveling light ; ;"
they would have to buy things for her .
She opened the door .
"Unimpressed , the dog plopped on the sand ."
Quint couldn't blame Maggie for disbelieving .
The swirling sand made Quint's limp more pronounced .
Now they were in friendly territory .
Here he was enclosed and safe .
Here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe .
He was Canute controlling the waves .
He hadn't intended to make the promise .
"Every piece of the nightmare was clear , in place ; ;"
`` Let's talk about the beach .
Dr. Fortman says swimming would help your leg .
He says you're limping more than you need to '' .
`` How does he know ? ?
He never had polio '' .
"`` You just wait , Dad ."
When you get back I'll probly be swimming better than Victoria .
"Wait and see , Dad '' ."
He called her `` Fatso '' .
`` She's got a nerve '' .
Quint said now to the clouds .
Strength began to zip up and down his chest .
He felt strong as a giant .
"`` Goolick , goooolick '' , creaked a sea gull ."
"`` Aw , shut up '' , he said ."
I can't go in .
I'm scared of the nightmare .
"Shivering , he put on his clothes ."
She was holding on to his rock with one hand .
She smelled of peppermints .
`` Why didn't you duck '' ? ?
`` This is my rock '' .
She was sore as a boil .
`` Ever hear of squatter's rights '' ? ?
They started with the Kansas-Nebraska Bill of eighteen '' --
"`` Mister Big Britches , aren't you '' ? ?"
`` I'm Mark Gordon Peters the Fifth .
They call me Quint '' .
`` Then why don't you stop squinting '' ? ?
`` I said Quint .
That's short for Quintus .
Quintus in Latin means '' --
Her cough sounded like cloth ripping .
`` I don't smoke '' .
`` Do you '' ? ?
"`` Sometimes eleven , fourteen a day '' ."
`` My mother never wops me .
I've got this leg brace '' .
"`` Dingy-looking '' , was what she said ."
`` Because maybe I won't have to wear it always .
She spouted a mouthful of water into the air .
`` A cane's mighty handy .
"Hey , will you look at that '' ? ?"
`` That's some dog .
What kind '' ? ?
"`` Part collie , part wire-haired terrier '' ."
He always did when people asked .
He's braver than he looks .
He's been sick lately .
Last Tuesday he went on a ham jag '' .
`` A what '' ? ?
"He would have told her , but Victoria was yodeling ."
That meant `` Mama wants you Quint .
Come home or I'll come find you '' .
`` I gotta go .
I come early in the morning '' .
`` So do I .
"See you around , Mister Squint '' ."
That was how they started being friends .
They met next morning and all the mornings thereafter .
it made her blister .
`` You going to marry the King '' ? ?
My hair is what he's nuts about .
Naturally curly hair runs in my family .
`` Which continent '' ? ?
"`` Name one , I been there '' ."
then they scraped off the mold and made fish soup .
Camels in Tripoli had harelips .
Quint smothered a yawn .
`` Books are for schnooks '' .
Nobody ever appreciated his jokes as much as Sabella .
That dog has to go '' .
`` Ever thought about going on the stage '' ? ?
`` Either that or a veterinarian '' .
`` You can't serve cod and salmon '' .
She said sharks have no bones and shrimp swam backward .
His encylopedia agreed with Sabella .
"Boy , could she catch ! !"
Like Willie Mays in the outfield .
`` Nobody gave me flowers before .
"Thank you , Quint '' ."
Her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough .
Sometimes they didn't talk at all .
He daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around .
Wednesday morning it happened .
They were eating breakfast .
"`` Your Daddy's in San Francisco '' , she told them ."
`` He says he'll be here on the one-o'clock plane .
Fifteen days early -- isn't that wonderful '' ? ?
"`` Yeah , keen '' ."
A cave seemed to be opening in Quint's stomach .
"`` Children , we'll have to get organized ."
The baby can have an early nap .
"Victoria , I want you to -- ''"
Quint closed the screen door quietly so Maggie wouldn't be scared .
The cave in his stomach hurt .
He had to go into the water .
He'd tell Sabella about the nightmare .
"What caused it , he didn't know ."
The metal collar gagging his neck ? ?
Sweating so much ? ?
The unbearable weight on his chest ? ?
All of it together meant drowning .
Everybody knew that John Cooper had married Edythe on the rebound .
`` Poor John '' ! !
You saw them always together those years .
You talked about John-and-Linda as an entity .
John-and-Linda were at Longue Vue last night ; ;
John-and-Linda drove to Conneaut in three and a half hours .
only this one didn't heal .
It got worse instead of better .
And then there was Linda's engagement to Bobbie Evans .
It wasn't even John and Edythe .
It was simply Poor John .
"`` Well , you shouldn't underestimate Edythe '' , Mousie said ."
Bobbie and Linda looked magnificent at their wedding .
"`` As if he were choking '' , she said ."
`` Poor John '' ! !
There were less-dramatic reasons too .
John was good at his job .
Everyone held his or her breath .
She knew what people were thinking ; ;
it was what she had been thinking herself .
There was no one who would blame her or John ; ;
she could be sure of that .
"Linda would have to wait , she knew ."
"Of course , he had done wonders ."
`` What did you do '' ? ?
"`` You must have done something , something wrong ."
Lord knows I had everything set for you '' .
"`` I'm behind John Cooper '' , Mr. Lovejoy said finally ."
"And also , the money can't mean as much to Bobbie ."
Most of the directors nodded .
Uncle Donald Murkland found himself nodding agreement too .
Poor John's rise continued to be meteoric .
`` Shirley appreciated the chance to make some money .
"`` That's swell '' , I said sweetly ."
I could get along without that three dollars .
I answered to find Nadine at the other end .
`` What's wrong '' ? ?
"`` Janice , nobody answers at the apartment '' ! !"
Her voice came shrill .
`` I'm absolutely frantic ! !
"`` Oh , she wouldn't do that '' , I said ."
`` She's probably fallen asleep and doesn't hear the phone .
But if you're worried you can go home and check '' --
`` I can't leave the party ! !
I was all set for what came next .
I'll call you there in ten minutes '' --
"`` Fifteen minutes , then ! !"
I'll be glad to pay you '' --
So sure that money could do anything ! !
"`` All right '' , I said ."
Not for the dollar or so Nadine would give me .
Her face was flushed from sleep .
"`` Mrs. Roberts had called , and couldn't wake you ."
"`` I'm -- hard to wake up '' , she faltered ."
She didn't look over thirteen .
And Nadine insisted that her sitters be reliable ! !
The phone started ringing .
"`` That's Mrs. Roberts again '' , I said ."
`` I'll answer it '' .
"`` Janice , would you mind staying '' ? ?"
Not a word of thanks for what I'd already done .
The receiver clicked in my ear .
She didn't even give me a chance to refuse .
I had always thought she was so beautiful .
But now she looked ugly .
"`` Pack your clothes '' , she hissed ."
`` Pack -- and get out '' ! !
"`` You're crazy '' , Wally said thickly ."
He insulted Ken Thom '' ! !
Her eyes were wild .
And the other people there were listening ! !
"`` you'd better simmer down '' , I said nervously ."
I was plenty scared .
"`` Tea , '' Nadine screeched ."
Wally's lost his job ! !
Ken will never forgive him -- never ! !
`` Stop that ! !
You'll wake up the whole building .
Wally can't go any place at this hour '' --
"`` You go to bed '' , I said curtly ."
"She collapsed against me , as if everything inside her snapped ."
Wally was snoring on the davenport .
I had done all I could .
I had done all I was going to do .
"I drove home , found Chris still asleep ."
Thankful I wasn't Nadine .
I kept on being thankful .
In the afternoon Nadine and Wally came over with Francie .
I -- got fired yesterday for not attending to business '' --
`` But Ken got coy and wouldn't make any promises .
And I was plastered and I blew my stack '' --
I tried to quiet Nadine because the children were there .
But she was beyond caring what she said .
Now maybe they'd realize that life can be tough .
"When A bubble breaks , there's nothing ."
"I said I wished we were , too ."
But Chris brightened up like a candle .
"`` I'm glad you feel that way , honey ."
There is one big way we can help them .
We can let them move in with us '' --
Something I had simply never thought of .
I just stared at him .
`` I know we'd be pretty crowded .
"`` I won't do it '' , I said flatly ."
"Then I felt uncomfortable , too ."
"I didn't want to be like that , mean and bitter ."
"But , in the end , we did ."
It just seemed as if there was nothing else to do .
Then Wally got sick .
"To my way of thinking , he was scared sick ."
"While I worked , Nadine sat and cried ."
"`` Virus infection nothing '' , she'd scream at him ."
You're just a no-good bum '' ! !
"It was a mess , all right ."
Nadine's constant nagging had finally gotten Wally out of bed .
Wendell Thom had black-balled him .
Nobody would even take his application .
"`` You can get something , '' Nadine would snap ."
But this was only the middle of July .
And I couldn't take six more weeks of this .
I don't really believe in intuition .
It was just going to be one of those days .
"And for the thousandth time , I answered myself ."
I hadn't chosen medicine -- it had chosen me .
I had a lot to be thankful for .
Especially in the way Gladdy had turned out .
But I mustn't start on Alice .
Should I tell him the truth about Alice ? ?
Alice But this woman's name was Rose Bancroft ! !
I looked at the chart for reassurance .
"Yes , Rose Bancroft , diagnosis : acute alcoholism ."
"Oh , could it be ? ?"
"she'd been picked up downtown , passed out in the doorway ."
It was the old story .
`` Hey '' ! !
Her voice was flat and dull .
It was then that I saw what the drawn-back covers revealed .
There were bloodspots on the sheet .
`` What's this '' ? ?
`` Your period '' ? ?
She shook her head .
`` Have you spoken to a doctor about it '' ? ?
"Once again , there was a negative shake ."
"`` Better do a Papanicolaou '' , I told Pete ."
I was busy the rest of the day .
"Late in the afternoon , I was up on Seven again ."
"On my way to the elevator , I ran into Pete ."
"`` There's something there , all right ."
"Class Three , they said ."
"Do you want to talk to her , Doctor '' ? ?"
"But that was ridiculous , of course ."
"Wants to get to her booze , I guess '' ."
I grimaced in distaste .
"`` Well , better see what I can do '' ."
`` I just got through seeing one of you guys .
What do you want '' ? ?
`` We'd like you to have a dilatation and curettage .
"That's quite minor , nothing to worry about ."
"It was flat , definite ."
`` Suppose you let me explain .
"Actually , I rather doubt that we'll have to do this ."
I looked at her in amazement .
`` Will you tell me why '' ? ?
"She smiled , a smile without humor ."
"`` I've got cancer , haven't I '' ? ?"
"She went on , disregarding my protests ."
`` I'm not going to be one of your guinea pigs .
"Let your pupils learn on someone else , Doctor ."
Just let me die in peace '' .
"I stared at her , almost speechless ."
Even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone .
"A long , long way down ."
"Again there was something familiar about her , something --"
And even if '' --
"`` Don't give me a lot of talk , Joe '' ."
I gaped at her .
"`` Surprised , baby ? ?"
"Guess I've changed , haven't I ? ?"
"But you haven't changed much , Joe '' ."
"I knew then , knew with a heart-stopping shock ."
`` Alice '' -- I stammered through dry lips .
"`` Alice , for goodness sake '' --"
"`` Alice '' , she echoed mockingly ."
"Well , don't worry ."
Just let me outta here '' --
`` But why did you come back '' ? ?
I'd found my voice .
`` Where have you been all these years '' ? ?
`` Here and there .
And this was Gladdy's mother ! !
Let me outta here ! !
"No , I want out , Joe '' ! !"
I looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me .
"If I let her go , she'd disappear once more ."
And Gladdy would be safe ! !
I was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea .
She made me welcome .
Her dark cool caresses were sweeter than any woman's ; ;
The reasons for this dive seemed foolish now .
Only the dive itself had any meaning .
"I chuckled aloud , and the mouthpiece fell out ."
I knew it wouldn't be the same .
That first time was good and it stuck with me .
I felt like a Hun in Rome .
everything was glamorous to my dazzled eyes .
I never got there .
"I met Claire , which was better ."
"`` Handsome soldier , I have assuaged one hunger with food ."
I feel another of terrible urgency .
Is your evening free '' ? ?
And so off we went to her apartment .
"She was a nymphomaniac , of course , the poor girl ."
I got there on a Saturday evening .
I made the mistake of going to the Jour et Nuit .
The place was busy but I didn't feel like a Hun .
I went to my hotel and slept .
So I drank more cognac .
I read the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer .
"Elemental , but sex ."
That's what was on my mind .
I felt better Tuesday evening when I woke up .
A good binge has that kind of therapeutic value .
Sometime earlier the weather had turned cold and it was snowing .
I went out into it .
"I had on only a topcoat , but I wasn't cold ."
I was just miserable .
Suddenly I understood why she had the umbrella .
It gave her poise and posture .
Without it she would have been drab and limp .
It gave her propriety .
I couldn't imagine her without it .
I knew all about her .
She was another human being and happened to be a hustler .
I didn't much care if she were there or not .
( I didn't have on a hat .
`` Is it a woman '' ? ?
She must have seen the ring on my left hand .
This took me so funny I had to look at her .
I even snorted a chuckle .
She was even more miserable than me .
`` Now isn't it better to smile '' ? ?
I could see she was shocked .
"She tilted up and drank , and then I drank ."
I wasn't going to lug around a glass .
I couldn't be sure .
Somehow she was attractive .
"I suppose we were cold , but we didn't feel it ."
I sensed no stranger in her .
I decided thirty-five was the best estimate of her age .
"I felt wonderful , the absolute opposite of last night's melancholy ."
My head was clear .
"Maybe closer to thirty , I thought ."
`` Bon jour '' ! !
"She exclaimed , smiling ."
`` J'ai faim '' ! !
"`` Yeah , but breakfast first '' ."
With a laugh she beat me to the bathroom .
I called downstairs for food and a toothbrush for her .
"`` The toothbrush Monsieur '' , he said , presenting it ."
I gave it to the woman .
`` What is this for '' ? ?
"`` Why , to brush your teeth '' ."
`` But I already have ! !
I used yours '' .
`` Oh '' ? ?
I said with round eyes .
"As we ate , we talked ."
"Her name was Suzanne , and mine Stephen ."
`` Um '' ? ?
"I grunted , sipping ."
I raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror .
"`` I didn't really use yours '' , she went on ."
`` I carry one in my purse .
I know men never kiss les putains '' .
`` All right '' .
I said with enthusiasm at the idea .
`` But not immediately '' .
I put aside my empty cup .
We were not rushed .
`` What is this from '' ? ?
"I asked , touching the scar on her stomach ."
"`` A bullet '' , she answered ."
"She understood sex anyway , and played at it well ."
"It was a nice place , not filled with smoke ."
We had champagne and steamed mussels .
He must have thought I was a tourist .
I didn't ask for a Jeroboam of champagne '' .
"I thought that was pretty humorous , but I didn't laugh ."
This was her first day in Rome and it was June .
An enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead .
There's nothing to stop me now .
In the street the traffic was really frightening .
She had heard about it the night before at her hotel .
Halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat down .
She loosened her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette .
how could you be both at once ? ?
"Strange , but she was ."
"Presently , she picked up the first of the letters ."
No return address whatsoever .
"Somebody had scrawled American Express , Piazza di Spagna ? ?"
He was full of heavy family reminiscence .
"The only boy , the family darling ."
`` Can you think of anything to do '' ? ?
Can you think of anything to do '' ? ?
`` Drop a cold key down his back '' .
"`` Poor Cousin Elec '' , George said ."
`` Poor Cousin Elec '' .
Theresa shifted to a new page .
But there is more in this than meets the eye .
A new bathroom would certainly have to be put in .
The wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally crumbling off .
'' ( Theresa skipped a page of details about the house .
"`` No '' , said Theresa ."
"`` No , no '' ! !"
The man did not wish to leave .
"Was he ever successful , Theresa wondered ."
"at last , alarm ."
"Finally , she scurried away up the steps ."
`` Signora '' ? ?
"`` Mi diapiace , Signora , ma insomma ."
`` Oh put it there '' ! !
She indicated a spot a little distance away .
"Susan Dolan , that's me ."
"I never heard my folks talk about her , though ."
My folks and my faith protected me from things like that .
I asked him if it was true .
"He gave me a straight , honest answer ."
"`` Look , Sue baby '' , he'd said ."
But it didn't seem fair .
He wasn't only different -- he was it .
I could hardly believe such good luck was mine .
And now Lucille Warren had gotten a look at him .
I didn't like it one bit .
But what could I do ? ?
Neither was his wife .
"She wouldn't have , even if he'd asked her ."
And he wouldn't leave her either -- he'd told me that .
Johnnie loved me and wanted me .
It was weeks before we even kissed for the first time .
The rides were tame enough -- mostly we talked .
"`` It's so crazy '' , I told him once ."
Somebody with no vices .
`` And you fall for a lumber jockey '' .
`` Who drinks far too much '' .
`` And smokes too much '' .
He examined his nails carefully .
`` I could walk out the door '' .
`` Don't you dare '' .
He still wasn't looking at me .
`` You wouldn't '' .
`` Or I could visit Lucille Warren '' .
`` I might '' .
And now he was seeing her .
He'd just admitted it to me .
I huddled miserably beside him in the truck .
It was all my doing -- his seeing her .
I had driven him into the arms of that scheming woman .
My very first time .
"I wanted him , with a terrifying fierceness ."
"`` Love me , Johnnie '' ."
"`` I will , kitten '' ! !"
`` Will you always love me this way '' ? ?
And I snuggled closer to the man I loved .
"`` It can't be wrong , can it ? ?"
Johnnie rose on one elbow .
It's never wrong if love is real '' .
"Infinite peace , complete contentment ."
"Idiot's delight , I later discovered ."
"I was practically a bride , after all ."
There would have been a ceremony if it had been possible .
"Of this , I had no doubt ."
Of course he would .
"He'd not only told me so , he'd proved it ."
"And if I could contribute to that , I'd do it ."
The cost didn't matter .
No price is too high when true love is at stake .
And I had no doubts about how true this love was .
What could a mere twelve years matter ? ?
And hadn't I rescued him from Lucille Warren ? ?
"She'd have gotten him , if I hadn't stopped her ."
"After all , Lucille Warren was a husband-stealer from way back ."
`` Love me '' ? ?
"`` Always and always , Johnnie '' ? ?"
Convention time in Boston .
I had mixed emotions about going .
So I went to Boston .
`` Need a pumpkin to get to the party '' ? ?
I couldn't help laughing with him .
"`` Well , I should find Alma '' -- I began ."
"`` Alma , Schmalma ."
Come along with me '' .
"But that was only natural , I decided ; ;"
surely he was still resting snugly in my heart .
"`` I don't see Alma anywhere '' , I said ."
`` She's invisible tonight .
"C'mon , let's find out where they're keeping the glasses '' ."
"`` I -- I don't think so , Ronald ."
Not for me '' .
"`` Aw , come on '' ."
`` No -- really '' .
But at least come along while I get lubricated '' .
The kitchen was jammed .
"Breakfast , he thought ."
A shot of orange juice would make everything seem better .
"Share bath , maybe -- but share refrigerator ? ?"
And where was the thing ? ?
"`` Take a full month '' , the doctor had said ."
"`` Lots of sun , lots of rest ."
The red pills are a vitamin-and-iron compound .
This is a sleeping capsule .
Charlie had accepted the diagnosis without comment .
The doctor could call it anything from flu to beriberi ; ;
`` Three-day blow '' ! !
"`` Fine , day after tomorrow '' , she added ."
"`` I hope so '' , he said ."
`` I've got this cold .
Thought I'd bake it out in the sun '' .
She studied him briefly .
`` You've got a peaked look .
Better get in out of the wet '' .
"Next morning , he found a note in the refrigerator ."
`` Would you mind wrapping your onion '' ? ?
`` The smell permeates everything '' ! !
He didn't want to encourage anything here ; ;
"`` Not onions '' , came the answer the following day ."
"Yes , take Vivian ."
`` What's that you say '' ? ?
"`` Oh , nothing ."
Just glad the rain's stopped '' .
"`` Oh , yes ."
Just look at that sky .
Be a scorcher by afternoon '' .
`` I hope so .
I've got this cold '' .
`` So you said '' .
"`` My , you're peaked ."
That pale kind's the worst '' .
"That pale kind , Charlie thought ."
Hardly an inviting description .
"But then , neither was peaked ."
`` He's that peaked kind '' .
Surely there was a better word .
Charlie looked in the mirror .
He looked more closely .
"Frail , feeble -- peaked ."
It gave him a good feeling .
"Thanks '' , was her answer the next day ."
"`` I've got this cold '' , he wrote ."
Not that it was any of her business .
"I mean , she's still living , and she's ninety-six ."
Why don't you try that '' ? ?
`` I don't have a lemon '' .
"By the next morning , she had turned the paper over ."
"`` Gee , neither do I '' ."
She didn't sound like a pale girl .
She sounded a little like a redhead .
"But then , redheads are often pale ."
He stuck his head in Mrs. Kirby's little rental office .
`` I guess that redhead next to me took your advice .
I haven't seen her on the beach '' .
"`` You won't , if you're looking for a redhead ."
She's got browny hair '' .
"On the beach , there were pale girls and not-so-pale girls ."
And he saw them all as he walked up and down .
Hope you don't mind '' .
"`` Of course I don't mind '' , she answered ."
"`` You're having a miserable time , aren't you ? ?"
"This was a very warm , sympathetic girl , he decided ."
Sympathy is a fine quality in a woman .
Suppose what's-his-name got a sunburn ? ?
Charlie couldn't see Vivian offering any hand lotion .
Correspondence passed back and forth .
`` How's your sunburn now ? ?
`` That Mrs. Kirby ! !
"I'll bet she told you I was puny , too ."
How's your cold '' ? ?
She didn't say you were puny .
What's puny '' ? ?
`` Puny goes with pale and peaked .
Do you have anything to read while you're shut up ? ?
but the picture of Tom Swift is pretty sinister .
Also the canoe '' .
For a few innings the Anniston team couldn't figure him out .
Third base '' ! !
But the Anniston boy had begun his slide too late .
The Anniston catcher screamed .
He jumped to his feet and started to throw punches .
The fighters were separated in a few minutes .
The game was resumed .
But Mike Deegan was boiling mad now .
"Mike Deegan was standing beside it , facing the field ."
"`` Keep your eyes open , sonny '' ! !"
Mike yelled to the catcher .
`` You're in for trouble '' .
The Anniston catcher did not reply with words .
He simply turned to Mike and smiled .
"`` Mind your own goddamn business '' , Mike Deegan said ."
Maybe the answer was in his eyes .
When Deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips .
The left fielder threw and it was a good one .
But Mike had no chance of being tagged .
The Anniston catcher was straddling home plate .
Both fell heavily to the ground .
Only Mike got to his feet .
The Anniston players and their manager ran out on the field .
They poured water over their catcher's face .
He did not move .
Then the manager called for a doctor .
The Riverside physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer .
"Mike Deegan was sitting on the bench , watching ."
The Anniston manager was coming over to the Riverside dugout .
He was followed by four of his men .
It began to look as if something was going to happen .
Mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer .
Eddie Lee moved over to Mike Deegan's side .
No one said a word .
His face was flushed .
`` That was a rotten thing to do '' .
"`` Stop it , will you ? ?"
Tell your guys not to block the plate '' .
`` You didn't have to ram him '' .
`` That's what you say '' .
The Anniston manager looked at Eddie Lee .
It was a cold and calculated look .
He turned and went back across the field to his dugout .
Everyone in the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting .
"Deegan fell into the dirt , the ball going over him ."
He arose slowly and brushed himself off .
`` Hit the bum '' ! !
Somebody yelled from the Anniston bench .
`` Look at those bastards '' ! !
"Charlie Haydon , a pitcher , said ."
`` They're looking for trouble '' .
Mike was slow getting into the box this time .
`` Listen '' ! !
He shouted to the pitcher .
`` One more and I'm coming out there '' ! !
`` I'll be waiting '' ! !
The pitcher yelled back .
The pitcher tossed his glove away and came towards Mike Deegan .
"They were both walking towards each other , unhurried ."
Riverside and Anniston players rushed out on the field .
There was much shouting and screaming .
Fights sprang up and were quickly squelched .
Phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head .
Frankie Ricco sat down on the bench near Phil .
The other players were undressing quietly .
Eddie Lee had not come in yet .
Mike went over to Phil and stood over him .
`` I didn't think it was necessary '' .
Now that's just fine ! !
You didn't think it was necessary '' .
Mike placed both his hands on his hips .
He pushed his jaw forward .
"`` Nobody else did , either '' ."
`` You trying to say I started the fight '' ? ?
`` I'm not trying to say anything '' .
And Phil banged his locker door shut and spun around .
"`` Phil , come into my office '' , Eddie said ."
Phil followed Eddie into the office and shut the door .
He sat down before Eddie's desk .
"`` I'm doing you a favor '' , Eddie said quickly ."
`` You get your unconditional release as of today '' .
Phil's eyes widened just a trifle .
You don't belong in professional baseball '' .
Phil had to clear his throat .
`` Is this because of what happened out there '' ? ?
"`` No '' , Eddie said ."
`` But it does confirm what I've suspected all along '' .
This is the second time .
"`` Sit down , sit down '' , Eddie said ."
`` I'm not saying you're yellow .
I am saying you're not a professional ballplayer '' .
Eddie Lee leaned forward over the desk .
"`` Now listen to me , Phil ."
I'm not steering you wrong .
You haven't got the heart for baseball '' .
Phil shook his head and Eddie frowned .
Suddenly his voice grew hard .
Phil started to say something but Eddie cut him short .
I know you've got talent .
"The heart , Phil ."
"Dazed , Phil said : `` I don't get it ."
"Eddie stood up abruptly , then sat down just as abruptly ."
`` What difference does your batting average make ? ?
Or your fielding average .
Or even the way you run bases .
That's what I mean by no heart for the game .
Deegan had no business ramming into that kid out there .
"It's a way of life , goddamit ! !"
It's only his opinion .
There were other clubs in this league .
He stood up slowly .
He was a little pale and shaky .
His lips felt glued together .
You'll get your pay in the morning '' .
Phil shut the door behind him .
`` What happened '' ? ?
Phil said : `` I got my release '' .
`` You crazy '' ? ?
`` What for '' ? ?
Frankie shook his head .
`` I don't get it '' .
"`` I don't know '' , Phil said ."
They were silent for a few moments .
Phil took off one shoe and stared at it .
"`` Don't take it like this '' , Frankie said ."
The leagues are full of guys like that '' .
Phil was very quiet .
"`` What are you gonna do , Phil '' ? ?"
Phil did not answer .
`` Why not try another club '' ? ?
"`` Springfield's in tomorrow '' , Frankie said ."
`` Talk to Whitey Jackson '' .
"`` Will you do it , Phil '' ? ?"
`` Do what '' ? ?
`` Ask Whitey for a job '' .
"`` Sure '' , he said ."
`` Springfield come in tomorrow '' ? ?
`` I'll speak to Whitey '' .
`` Atta boy '' .
"`` I'll talk to him , all right '' ."
"`` Don't worry '' , Frankie said ."
`` You'll get a job there .
He needs outfielders bad '' .
"`` I'm not worried about it '' , Phil said ."
`` That's the way to talk .
What else did Eddie have to say '' ? ?
"`` Nothing '' , Phil said ."
Richard's next interest seemed the product of his insularity .
`` Did you think there were two '' ? ?
"`` You don't understand '' , Richard said gloomily ."
The week at home was not comfortable .
Have you ever been to Ryusenji '' ? ?
I was thoroughly startled '' .
Sushi was Out because it was pretentious .
`` Did you watch him '' ? ?
Asked a red-haired girl named Ceecee Witter .
`` I shouldn't have been able to do that '' .
"`` For a minute , anyhow ."
I'm surprised no one has been there .
I've been there a number of times .
"Sam , I thought you knew everything about Tokyo ."
You've never been to Ryusenji '' ? ?
"`` I've heard about it '' , Samuel Burns said ."
"Oh , that's what I meant to tell you ."
`` Twenty-two or twenty-three '' .
It would kill one of us '' .
It was true ; ;
The conversation went on but Richard stopped listening .
"The strange creature , housed in wire , made him shudder ."
He walked all the miles back to his room .
"You beauty , I said , I couldn't kill you ."
You are much too beautiful .
"I felt good and satisfied , looking at the snake ."
I saw it all at a glance .
It was no use .
"I drove the tractor on , not looking down there ; ;"
I felt the anger mount within me .
I knew the boy well .
He was eleven and we had done many things together .
`` Can I ride around with you '' ? ?
the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his .
"I pointed to the splintered , upright stake ."
`` Did you do that '' ? ?
`` I killed a snake ; ;
it was a big one '' .
He tried to take my hand to show me .
`` Why did you kill it '' ? ?
`` Snakes are ugly and bad '' .
`` This snake was very beautiful .
Didn't you see how beautiful it was '' ? ?
"`` Snakes are ugly '' , he said again ."
"`` You saw the colors of it , didn't you ? ?"
Have you ever seen anything like it around here '' ? ?
`` You know there are no poisonous snakes in this area .
This snake could not harm anything '' .
"`` They eat chickens sometimes '' , the boy said ."
"`` You are talking foolishly '' , I said ."
`` Nobody likes snakes '' .
The fire of the colors was gone ; ;
there was a contorted ugliness now ; ;
"The boy came around behind me , dragging the stake ."
"`` It's a big snake , isn't it '' ? ?"
`` Don't you see what you have done '' ? ?
`` Don't you see the difference now '' ? ?
"`` It's an ugly , terrible snake '' , he said ."
"`` Don't '' , I said ."
I could have slapped the boy .
Hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago .
Cady Partlow lit his pipe with no comfort .
He wondered if he had played it wrong .
Maybe he should have kept in touch .
Gone back for reunions .
"Besides , Cady Partlow knew he wasn't the old-grad-type ."
It wouldn't help anyway .
Pete's son was rejected .
Cady looked at his own son's scholastic record with pride .
Imagine his son being that good in science ! !
"But then , he hadn't studied very hard ."
He put down his pipe and started to type .
He didn't have to be told his son looked like him .
He turned back to the typewriter with a little more confidence .
"Just give him time , give him a chance ."
His eyebrow went up in amusement at his soul-searching panic .
He told Hanford his son had participated in numerous high-school activities .
"There , that did it ."
He shoved the unsealed letter into his coat pocket .
Anne had a way with words .
"Half of it was natural , half was Smith College ."
A woman had it or she didn't .
She said what she meant and let it be .
She never got on his back .
He could take the advice or leave it .
`` I was just thinking how things have changed .
When I went to college they begged you to come .
Be our guest ! !
It's our pleasure ! !
Tom slid open the door to the lobby .
"`` That's a fact , Mr. Partlow ."
My John applied to six colleges before he got in '' .
`` Going to State '' ? ?
Always messing around with science stuff .
"Real bright along those lines , you might say ."
He got a science scholarship to Yale '' .
They had all turned down his son .
He liked looking at Anne .
She always could sense the shag end of a woolly day .
"`` Board meeting tonight , Cady '' ? ?"
"`` No , I begged off ."
Work to do '' .
"`` Can I have the car , Dad '' ? ?"
"`` Why not let him take it , Cady ? ?"
Let's forget the rules '' .
"Cady , deep in thought , neither heard nor answered ."
"`` I'm sorry , Dave ."
Of course you can have it '' .
"`` Hear anything from Hanford yet , Dad '' ? ?"
Cady begged the question .
"`` Don't worry about it , Dave ."
Your acceptance will come through '' .
"`` Don't be too sure , Dad ."
Dave kissed her lightly .
Get my old man to bed early .
He looks a little bit frayed '' .
`` Let's go into the library .
You do seem somewhat tattered '' .
`` I didn't know I looked so dilapidated '' ! !
"`` Wrong word , darling ."
Need any help '' ? ?
"`` In a way , yes ."
Hanford College hasn't decided on Dave's application yet .
Here's what I wrote '' .
Already he could feel Anne's questioning eyes .
That was when half the school was down with flu '' .
`` And he wasn't really elected treasurer of the science club .
Cady stuck his jaw out .
`` The fact remains he was treasurer '' .
`` And the swimming team .
"No , Cady , he made second team ."
Just missed the first '' .
"`` A team is a team '' , insisted Cady ."
`` Anything else '' ? ?
"`` Yes '' , she said quietly ."
"`` I don't think you've been quite honest , Cady ."
It isn't like you .
He was mad about stars at the age of nine .
Those aren't his interests now '' .
`` What do you suggest '' ? ?
He hasn't been to a symphony concert all season '' .
`` You mean that rock-and-roll combo ? ?
"He's -- he's just there , that's all '' ."
"`` Yes , he's just there ."
He keeps the beat going .
He likes to play bass because he doesn't have to solo .
He doesn't like to rise and shine .
Cady appeared slightly mollified .
He has to have leadership as well as grades '' .
Anne folded the worrisome document .
He hasn't used it now for several years .
`` And what would you say he wants to do ? ?
Just what '' ? ?
`` It's Dave who is applying to Hanford College .
Why don't you ask him '' ? ?
I won't be guilty of trying to run his life '' .
But subconsciously you've wanted him to conform to your mold .
Cady put the well-worn chip back on his shoulder .
`` Dave has qualities of leadership .
He just hasn't developed them yet .
Give him time '' .
"He never will , Cady ."
All your wishful thinking won't change that .
Remember what you used to say in the Army ? ?
"And once begun , had grown to such monstrous proportions ."
The pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life .
He had always been a messy and negligent man .
No doubt Dolores resented following in their footsteps .
Half slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things .
"But , to put it bluntly , nothing snapped ."
"Yet that had not seriously troubled him , not then ."
More he could take at leisure .
He saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly .
They had left themselves too much to discover .
"But , at the start , his new life felt invigorating ."
) that he dropped the shorts on the floor .
Martin gave her a teasing pat .
`` I think you'll get tired of them there '' .
In the morning the shorts were where he had left them .
It was almost too easy .
Quietly he determined to foil her .
my nerves are as strong .
She'll rush to the bedroom when the doorbell rings .
Martin was standing a few feet from the front door .
Dolores stood motionless in the doorway .
Martin turned his back .
He strode to answer the bell .
Bill's hat was deposited in the hall closet .
Martin strained his ears .
At first he could not be sure .
A glissade of giggles slid over their voices .
"All evening Anthea favored him with odd , coy looks ."
At last there was a void no one could fill .
The Brainards went home early .
As violently as possible .
And if he surrendered after raving at her .
Suppose he ran up the white flag altogether ? ?
He considered the sober possibility .
In his head was the echo of those titters with Anthea .
He could even recall the last time he sat there .
The battle had to be fought .
Let the best sex win .
But his resolution hardly seemed to help .
"If the situation had been bad , it now got worse ."
"Of course , the tours of inspection included the ever-present shorts ."
It was curious how the different visitors took this .
Some tried to ignore the blot on the bedroom's countenance .
Quite a few laughed .
To them all Dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale .
While he waited in the living room .
Once Martin went along .
"They entered the bedroom , and Dolores said nothing ."
Then one of the guests showed his merriment .
"`` You were in a hurry , weren't you '' ? ?"
Martin would have liked to break the man's neck .
she let the interpretation stand .
Now Martin heard himself give a snort of mock good nature .
They kept up a rigid pretense of speaking relations .
But Martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything .
What to talk about ? ?
The shorts alone remained .
The sound of their amazement .
Bizarre : He could hear the word .
The most bizarre situation .
We were up to visit them and
He had thought her exactly what he wanted .
Everyone would know why ; ;
he would cut a supremely ridiculous figure .
"His mind scurried frantically , seeking an exit ."
"Nothing would change , nothing would ever change ."
"In a frenzy of excitement , he considered his plan ."
"Beside his shorts , he would place something of hers ."
"Sooner or later , Dolores would crack ."
"The tale , he thought , would become less gay ."
He sat down on the bed .
"In a surprisingly short time , Dolores appeared ."
"Well , Martin thought , That'll save ."
He left for work in high spirits .
"`` Good old A-Z '' , Cap said ."
Isn't his racket down your alley '' ? ?
"Once it was , William thought ."
But not any more .
"Simply enough , through the inadvertent agency of his brother-in-law ."
"Shortly after , Freddy had his usual proliferation of bold ideas ."
"Whatever the reasons , Willis and Bryan started expanding Zenith ."
"Feeling his power , Freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer ."
"Heavy industry , slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers , attracted him ."
At that point William came into the picture .
The conversion will cost a fortune .
Here are a few facts and figures I've assembled .
Willis glanced at the bound pages given him and shrugged .
Freddy is deeply committed to our plans already .
"`` Yes , I appreciate that ."
I wish you wouldn't tell Freddy I'm lukewarm ; ;
"`` Which is a frightful prospect , Bill '' ."
Let me think about it .
The Wisconsin plant turned out to be a white elephant .
Stock Willis held in abundance fell sharply in value .
Once more Willis summoned William .
Freddy's solution doesn't appeal to me .
Will you see if you can help me '' ? ?
William spent a long week end closeted with Hamrick .
Then he caught fire .
"Taking Hamrick with him , William went to Mr. Willis ."
I wish I was younger and less timid .
"Well , I can't resolve this myself ."
I'll have to call in the brain trust .
Are you willing to run the gantlet ? ?
I can't guarantee you a sympathetic audience '' .
"If they follow anyone , it'll have to be you '' ."
"You mustn't take a fall , or publicly back away ."
You're -- you're Arthur Willis .
Forgive the hearts and flowers theme '' .
"`` I rather like the music '' , Willis replied quietly ."
`` Thank you '' .
"Move over , General Motors '' ."
`` You're leading Dad down the garden path '' .
"`` I don't enjoy family quarrels '' , Adam said ."
`` Nor crazy relatives .
We're here to transact business .
"Can't we put an end to this , Arthur '' ? ?"
"`` Hear me out , please '' , William begged ."
They tried to sell 'em on economy and simple merit .
We've arrived at an age for romance and snobbery .
Look what those little European jobs are doing .
"He swayed them somewhat , but the debate raged on ."
Financing emerged as the main obstacle .
Mr. Willis made it evident that he had contributed his maximum .
`` I know what I'm talking about in that department '' .
"`` All right '' , William said ."
`` We'll try to swing the deal on that basis .
"If we can't raise the capital , we're through ."
Nothing has been lost .
You're up against it anyhow .
Why won't you give me a chance '' ? ?
Heads instinctively turned in Willis' direction .
He smiled at William and slowly rubbed his hands together .
Good luck to you '' .
Nobody else showed pleasure .
"`` Hello , boss '' , he said , and grinned ."
`` I'm afraid not '' .
Then it was that District Attorney Welch entered the case .
Welch wanted to know why .
"`` Barco , we've got the goods on you ! !"
It'll be a lot better if you come clean '' .
At first Barco was evasive and shifty .
Welch summoned jail officials to Barco's cell .
Barco was clearly a `` nut '' .
"It required strength , bravado , daring to commit murder ."
`` That worm a murderer ? ?
His manhood had been attacked .
He stiffened and rose to his feet .
He'd show them ! !
`` Is that so '' ? ?
"`` Well , for ten years I've been murdering women ."
Orders were given to dig .
The police captain chortled .
The newspaper boys cracked jokes and again Barco's pride was aroused .
"With quibs and gibes , the policemen again started digging ."
Welch was on edge .
`` There's something here '' ! !
Joking stopped and everyone gathered around .
Welch was wild with delight .
"It went to his head , and his ambition increased ."
"He was bitter and resentful toward her , personally resentful ."
I did not rest until I had tracked the mystery down .
"Well , here it is ."
And here it was ! !
By such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set in motion .
I hated being dragged into the salons of these aristocrats .
I sat and watched proceedings .
"Jennie and Miranda twined themselves around me , murmuring endearments ."
I'm not saying it right .
"How about them , I thought ."
the yellow pages of the telephone book were amazingly thin ) .
They were `` personalities '' .
"No , not Bermuda ."
Bermuda was not in style that year .
They had honeymooned in Rome ; ;
everyone was very high on Rome that year .
bright pinks and plaids and vivid stripes .
"No one could dislike them , I thought ."
"Sometimes , though , they did not seem quite human ."
I couldn't feel at home among them .
"Besides Francesca , there was Blanche ."
"Francesca was pleasant and charming , but Blanche was sweet ."
"But dear me , no ; ;"
the pets were a couple of Siamese cats .
I couldn't tell one from the other .
One or two were writers of books ; ;
all were fellows of finite charm .
In deference to country-squirehood .
I wouldn't have missed it for anything .
"who were more ingratiating than gracious , more personalities than persons ."
`` Bananas '' ! !
Jennie had shouted each time .
`` They're not dessert ! !
They're not even food .
I'm a stranger in paradise '' .
The litigation was costly and seemingly endless .
But the Supreme Court wouldn't even hear my case ! !
My plea was unanimously voted down and `` thrown out '' .
"Again , my name was on all the front pages ."
Henry Ford spoke of me as `` utterly astounding '' .
Could it do otherwise ? ?
( But that is another story .
It almost always works out for the best .
These are but a sampling of the insults I endured .
And did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf ? ?
He did not ! !
The `` shooting '' went on for eight months ! !
But it was small consolation .
( An actor must have discipline .
It was a disaster ! !
"In clothes , Letch simply did not project ."
He was laughed off the screen .
`` What is Letch interested in '' ? ?
"`` Bookies , booze and babes '' , Momma said bluntly ."
It wasn't his fault that these things were so .
Dogs did something to one's ego .
Or was the answer less metaphysical ? ?
Did older people work more slowly ? ?
There was no compulsion behind them .
He looked at the luminous dial of his wrist watch .
It was five minutes after four .
At least he could buy the equipment for his workshop .
"Thus committed , action might follow ."
"`` There '' , said Mr. Mills ."
`` That'll get you started .
Best not to get everything at once .
Add things as you find you need 'em '' .
He didn't even ask the cost of this collection .
In front of it would be his workbench .
After the pegboard there would be the paneling .
It all seemed rather hopeless .
He turned his attention to the workbench .
Perhaps that was the first thing to do .
They lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile .
Mr. Crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot .
After that everything should be simpler .
He went upstairs to phone Crumb .
To his amazement he reached him .
Mr. Crumb was laid up with a bad cold .
That was why he hadn't been able to finish the porch .
"No , he didn't know of any handyman-carpenter ."
There wasn't any such thing any more .
There was a fellow named Blatz over Smithtown way .
Mr. Blatz agreed that this would be pretty .
It all did look very efficient and shipshape .
There was no question of that .
I guess you know about that .
He followed Mr. Blatz up the cellar stairs .
Mr. Blatz sat down in the only unoccupied kitchen chair .
Mr. Crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression .
Mr. Crombie couldn't remember his saying any such thing .
"`` Oh , that's wonderful '' , cried Mrs. Crombie ."
`` I have a thousand things for you to do .
But the discussion was academic .
"Ben Franklin said , `` Clearly spoken , Mr. Fogg ."
You explain English by Greek '' .
One species of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition .
"`` I'm terribly upset '' , she told a girl-friend ."
Another case involves a newspaper reporter who tripped up a politician .
`` Good '' ! !
`` What's the name of his other leg '' ? ?
Journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips .
Classified ads are also chockfull of misrelated constructions .
"View takes in five counties , two bedrooms '' ."
`` Officials Meet on rubbish .
Many Shapes in bathtubs .
Son and Daughter of Local Couple Married '' .
The newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the anatomical .
Samples : He walked in upon her invitation .
She kissed him passionately upon his reappearance .
He kissed her back .
Not without good reason has the anatomical been called jocular journalese .
"Strangely enough , this always brought the house down ."
A conscientious girl became the secretary of a doctor .
It read : `` Shot in the lumbar region '' .
"`` That's silly -- lemon in mouth '' , she said ."
The comic indefinite comprises an extensive class of comedy .
A woman met a famous author at a literary tea .
The girl nodded understandingly .
Where were you '' ? ?
Her woolly-minded parent agreed .
"`` Of course , dear '' , she said ."
No less ambiguous was the indefinity of a certain clergyman's sermon .
And yet it is not .
It is but so-so '' .
The bodies must be cleaned and seats wiped off '' .
`` What are my chances for taking Joe's place '' ? ?
`` What have you got on today '' ? ?
"`` A blue suit '' , he answered ."
`` Who's in it '' ? ?
"`` I am '' , he said ."
There was a short pause for reflection .
"`` No '' , she smiled , `` objected '' ."
Ambiguity arises when the pronoun it carries a twofold reference .
Two friends were talking .
My husband is in great pain .
A bee's place is in the hive '' .
Did you go to their funeral '' ? ?
"`` I was wrong '' , I admitted ."
"`` Comedy didn't die , it just went crazy ."
There are even publications called Sick and Mad .
it is manic as a man '' .
Do you want to hear the paraphrase '' ? ?
`` Can I bear it '' ? ?
Foreigners this way ' ! !
`` What's the matter with the music '' ? ?
"`` It doesn't drown out the dialogue '' , I explained ."
"`` Let's talk about books '' , Moreland said ."
Is it all non-fiction '' ? ?
"`` There is non-fiction and non non-fiction '' , I said ."
"Moreland asked , grimly ."
"`` Cryptic '' , I said ."
"`` I know what you mean '' , Moreland sighed ."
We sat for a while drinking in silence .
There was a long silence .
`` Or perhaps a new Noel Coward '' ? ?
I myself hear it said constantly -- in drawing-rooms .
I stood up and began pacing .
"`` Furiouser and furiouser '' , I said ."
Borrowing a line from Don Marquis' Mehitabel .
then he turned to me .
"`` Oh , that is demonstrable '' , I told him ."
"`` That is only partly non-nonsense '' , he began ."
"The rhinos would panic , screaming help ! !"
-- if that can be screamed in their language '' .
`` Such as '' ? ?
`` What a nasty fall was there '' ! !
Complete power not only corrupts but it also attracts the mad .
He looked so comfortable being straight .
They wanted to touch the mystery .
Arlene was boosting them up when the policeman came by .
He was very rude .
"Arlene had a hard voice , too , this time ."
The policeman's eyes rather popped for a second ; ;
"The policeman walked on , but he looked back once ."
and they had told their mother about the tumbles .
and so they were consistently true to their principles .
`` What is it '' ? ?
"First , Arlene had put them through some rapid somersaults ."
They had protested that that wasn't any surprise .
`` This is a warm-up '' .
`` Is it anything like cooked-over oatmeal '' ? ?
Asked one of the children .
"`` Not the least bit '' , Arlene snapped ."
But not hard for very long .
Just long enough to make you feel important .
Their curiosity went happily out of bounds .
They both laughed and winked back .
And she would wink and throw kisses .
"But they kept on clapping for a long , long time ."
"This time , it was so grand ; ;"
they could tell exactly what it was .
It was General Burnside's horse running in a circle .
"The first one said , `` He sure does shake ."
Then there was the General kissing his wife .
They had to be told that one .
But it was even funnier after they had been told .
But not General Burnside .
He was the funniest man .
"Then , they had to get up and be General Burnside ."
It wasn't very funny .
and they did some somersaults .
"But that wasn't very funny , either ."
"`` You ought to shake '' , Arlene advised them ."
And Arlene showed them how to begin .
That helped a lot .
"They were clumsy , but they were beginning to catch on ."
That helped a great deal .
They were a little late in getting home .
My mother constituted herself the voice of all of us .
`` I suppose you all were playing and forgot '' ? ?
"`` Yes , ma'am '' , the children chorused heartily ."
We couldn't help laughing .
The children rushed off to get rid of their sweaters ; ;
and Arlene began tapping the kitchen door open .
That tap had a slight bangish quality .
Her upper lip lifted slightly .
She was biting into a small red radish ; ;
"It never worked , naturally ; ;"
but it made her look unusual .
"One could hear a very faint , ladylike sigh of relief ."
"Actually , it was inaudible to anyone not expecting it ."
"Later on , the children told her further about somersaulting ."
`` It must be awfully good for them .
"And awfully kind of Arlene '' , she told us later ."
`` But do you know something curious '' ? ?
I have no notion why I reached .
And I found a radish .
Was it an omen ? ?
I thought for a second .
But I would not pamper myself in that silly way .
I opened the window and threw the radish out '' .
"Then , my mother blushed at this small lie ; ;"
Arlene became indispensable ; ;
nobody could have told why .
It was in the air .
A friend of my father's came to dinner .
He was passing through town and phoned to say hello .
"As a result , he was persuaded out to dinner ."
"Sometimes , he coincided with my father's being at home ."
"Sometimes , as at this juncture , he did not ."
But he was always persuaded out .
"He liked children , in a loathsome kind of way ; ;"
"The children loathed him , too ."
We had just sat down .
`` We have good times '' .
This happy bulletin convulsed Mr. Gorboduc .
`` You do '' ? ?
"He asked , between wheezes of laughter ."
He was forced to wipe his eyes .
"`` You don't step on the flowers , do you ? ?"
"`` No '' , he said ."
`` We don't '' .
Mr. Gorboduc took a swig of his sherry .
But this time she was nervous : she was open .
Mr. Gorboduc was finally in command of his mind again .
"`` We bump '' , one said ; ;"

The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relations .
That objective set the high stakes and drama of the Vienna meeting .
The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads into the Middle East .
He did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary .
"Above all , he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to Premier Khrushchev's doorstep ."
"Ideally , he knew , it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels ."
"Mr. Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements , or even negotiations , impossible ."
Developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting .
Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow that the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive .
He has indicated that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is out .
The approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at Vienna .
The inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations .
Premier Khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway .
"This time the initiative came , in part at least , from Washington ."
There is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world .
Disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse .
"There is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture ."
But the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official American Catholic project ; ;
"Official encouragement is one thing , but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds ."
They have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made .
Community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible .
It is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment .
This `` family-community '' spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement .
this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough .
In the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel .
"Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession , much given to attending meetings and conferences ."
Much has been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure .
This is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated .
This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure .
In the case of academic personnel the `` feeling '' of participation can hardly be `` faked '' .
The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program .
Rep. Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the Armed Services Committee .
Neither has Congressman Martin nor Senator McClellan been heard from on the matter ; ;
they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions .
"The anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines ; ;"
it must play a game in which there never is a winner .
The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law .
Accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price .
"Should these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industry ."
Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by `` unfair competition '' .
Engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants .
And which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday ? ?
The question might be asked : `` Don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ? ?
This escape from control has led to management's evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while .
Those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform .
"The Wagner Act , the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining ."
The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition .
Human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America .
"Eighteenth-century England , upon whose customs our common law was built , had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies ."
"There were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining , but against labor monopoly ."
"In People vs. Fisher , Justice Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared :"
Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation .
The suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment .
Labor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws .
) The court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce .
"Afterward , Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen ."
"What Herter presented , said Gore , was `` not a very encouraging review '' ."
There was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts .
He began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of Aj .

"( In the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week , Judge Smith threatened reprisal against Powell ."
Said he : `` We will see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here '' .
"Smith flatly rejected the offer , and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels ."
"He shouted , and rushed off to the Speaker's Room to object : `` A dangerous precedent '' ! !"
"As the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses , it became clear that Judge Smith could lose ."
") In all three arenas , they seemed certain of victory -- especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash ."
But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war .
"`` One wants a little more power , and the other doesn't want to give up any '' ."
"Fair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante , asked cloture power for a mere majority of Senators ."
"Privately , the liberals admitted that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage ."
"Nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace , then went beyond the required `` sufficient declaration '' ."
The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves .
The Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer .
"As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course , Player was almost in tears ."
"Afterwards , Palmer told Charlie Coe , his last-round partner , that he simply played the hole too fast ."
"But Palmer knew , as did everybody else at Augusta , that his streak was about to be broken ."
"As if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments ."
But whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour .
Player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer .
"On Thursday , the first day of the Masters , the contest between Palmer and Player developed instantly ."
"or Rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries ; ;"
( On Thursday nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe .
"`` I was hitting the ball well '' , Player said later , `` and I felt strong ."
Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget .
"Starting the second nine , Palmer was already four strokes behind Player and knew it ."
This is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous .
Experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused by expansion .
"Their names are Mantle and Maris , their team is the Yankees , and their threat is real ."
This is the great edge the two Yankees have going for them .
"With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes made to order ."
"Mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or , for that matter , to private speaking ."
`` What do you and Mickey talk about at home '' ? ?
"`` To tell you the truth '' , Maris said , `` Mickey don't talk much '' ."
"Of the two , Mantle is by nature the less outgoing , Maris the more outspoken ."
( Farrell did -- and Maris led the team to victory in the Little World Series .
One good indication of the two men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes .
"`` When you came up to the majors , did you seek out Williams for advice '' ? ?"
"Among all the Yankees , he is the veteran most friendly to rookies ."
Neither Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else .
"But since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts , Mantle and Maris concentrate on baseball ."
") Hitting , Mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed , Maris only left-handed ."
"They both possess near classic stances , dug in firmly , arms high , set for fierce swings ."
Both are good bunters : Maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues ; ;
"Both are good , daring fielders : Mantle covers more ground ; ;"
"With this ultimate weapon , the two Yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season ."
Said Leatherneck Shoup : `` A year ago I took the grips of the plow in my hands .

"Holmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse ( Negro ) College , where he is a B student and star halfback ."
But Holmes was rejected again `` on the basis of his record and interview '' .
"No , said he , but officials still called him `` evasive '' ."
They also said he lied in saying that he had never been `` arrested '' .
The state will appeal -- but few think it will actually try to close the university .

Beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters ; ;

"The religions of the people include Christianity , Mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism ."
The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars .
To make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case ; ;
At first the Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private property .
"The Belgian government itself took over administration , commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism ."
The honor of the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment .
"Had they been truly ruthless , the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese without compassion ."
They provided a social security system which covered all their African employes ; ;
their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent ; ;
"But they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college ."
Why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it ? ?
"They lacked time to prepare the Congo , as the British and French had prepared their colonies ."
"The Congolese were clamoring for their independence , even though most were unsure what it meant ; ;"
"and in Brussels , street crowds shouted , `` Pas une goutte de sang ! !"
The Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue ; ;
"rather than teach where teaching was not wanted , they would wash their hands of the mess ."
"However , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting ."
"Thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other , and to them independence meant an opportunity for war ."
Well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations .
Terror engulfed the thousands of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country .
"He quickly called on Ghana , Tunisia , Morocco , Guinea and Mali , which dispatched troops within hours ."
It took the U.N. three months to bring a modest form of order to the Congo .
The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U.N. efforts .

Taking precedence over all other legislation on Capitol Hill last week was the military strength of the nation .
White House legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact .

Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes .
Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative .
That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates .
Another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds .
"On balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then ."
"However , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as a group , have bucked this trend ."
"Investors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds ."
You find the evidence of that in the chart on this page .
"It's not much more , in fact , than the return that is offered on U. S. Treasury bonds ."
"The report is based on a survey by Blyth & Company , investment bankers ."
Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period .
Many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter .
The road's engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston .
Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do .
"Progress is being made , too , in improving motorists' access to many turnpikes ."
Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals .
Traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike .
"Already , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins ."
Many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point .
"`` Follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant , and you learn this :"

"Within a year , without reducing wages , Underwood's production costs were cut one third , prices were slashed ."
"`` The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout , modern machinery ."
`` Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the U.S. .

"Note , too , that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U.S. textile industry ."
"In veiled terms , that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industry ."
"The Government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines , where modernization doesn't seem feasible ."
Yet U.S. coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water .
"Many of the coal seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting , narrow and very deep ."
The British Government will have to decide whether to let U.S. coal in .
"The British coal industry is unprofitable , has large coal stocks it can't sell ."
Under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts .
"Within a system , however , the autonomy of each member library is preserved ."
"The collection may be in an existing library , or it may be built up in a central collection ."
The entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans .
The books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries .
"while Hewlett-Woodmere is the repository of art , music , and foreign languages ."
Further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing .
The system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together ; ;
"Headquarters of the Nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days , threatening to expand beyond its boundaries ."
it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used ; ;
"The system itself is governed by a board of trustees , geographically representing its membership ."
"Library use is multiplying daily , and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned Americans , the teen-agers ."
The desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life .

Newspapermen and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs .
"The harder the choice , the more willing the league is to wade in ."
"And the league takes a stand , with great regularity , on the side of right ."
The danger lay not in believing that our own A-bombs would deter Russia's use of hers ; ;
The danger lay in the American delusion that nuclear deterrence was enough .
This strategy heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear war .

Both Mr. K's have so far continued to speak softly and carry big sticks over Laos .
But at the same time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the fighting .
"For Mr. Kennedy , speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation ."
He must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says .
In this case he has put the alternatives clearly to Mr. Khrushchev for the third time .
At the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position .

"Sam Rayburn was a good man , a good American , and , third , a good Democrat ."
"Mr. Speaker , Mr. Sam , and Mr. Democrat , at one and the same time ."
Mr. Rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label .
"He was not a rear-looking conservative , yet partisans of that persuasion will miss him as much as any ."
It might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs .
"When it was not , one of the great dramas of Washington would be presented ."
"He spoke briefly , sensibly , to the point and without oratorical flourishes ."
"He made good , plain American common sense and the House usually recognized it and acted upon it ."
He expected Democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them .

Word of Dag Hammarskjold's death in an African plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe .
It was on the eve of a momentous U.N. session to come to grips with cold war issues .
"Whether this , or overt action , was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined ."
The death of Mr. Hammarskjold removes the United Nations' most controversial leader .
He was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice .
"The Congo , in whose cause he died , was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs ."
The U.N. session scheduled for today will meet under the cloud of his passing .

"Americans are a nation of joiners , a quality which our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing ."
But it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn't want to make a spectacle of himself .
One specific example is a secret `` fraternity '' which will `` coordinate anti-Communist efforts '' .
The principle is commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get gulled .
Does it attack other traditional American institutions with unsupportable and wild charges ? ?
Does it put the label of un-American or subversive on everyone with whom it disagrees politically ? ?
Does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing campaigns ? ?
"And what you can't see , the land underneath the water , belongs to someone , too ."

We submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law -- and one of its principal aims .
Without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily .
"In cooperating toward that objective , OAS might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the United States ."

But so convinced of communism's inevitable triumph is Prince Sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel .
"`` I have to see the facts '' , is the way the prince puts it ."
And from that point of vantage he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-Western posture .
Commerce Secretary Hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official Washington's economic forecasters .
He is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump .
Prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut .
The desirability of preserving such places as the Cape dunes and Stone Harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every year .
"Anybody who is expecting a joyride should , according to Mr. Shriver , get off the train right now ."
"First of all , the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling ."
St. Louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing and in some places stagnant mid-continent region .
Slackened regional demand for St. Louis goods and services reflects the region's relative lack of purchasing power .
"Not all St. Louis industries , of course , have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood ."
The city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate Missouri and Southern Illinois .

"Carbondale is in the Herrin-Murphysboro-West Frankfort labor market , where unemployment has been substantially higher than the national average ."
Politics-ridden St. Clair county in Illinois presents another piece of the problem of metropolitan development .
More industrial acreage lies vacant in St. Clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the St. Louis area .
The unstable political situation there represents one reason new plants shy away from the East Side .
Still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far .
"Take , for example , the reformers among New York City's Democrats ."
But it is tradition rather than the record which balks at the expunging of the Tammany name .
They will -- when they give up the donkey and the elephant .
The Kennedy Administration had assured anti-Castro Cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates of Dictator Batista .
the Colonel fled to the friendly haven of the Dominican dictatorship as soon as Castro seized power .
Gen. Swing has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office .
At that point the Administration will have little reason to hang onto Gen. Swing .
The Faget case was the kind of salvage job the Administration should not have to repeat .
Nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the Corps or its welcome reception abroad .
The crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded .
"Ex-Presidents , relieved of accountability for policy , sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their words ."
Mr. Eisenhower's New York speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship .
Economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines .
This would be cheaper to operate and could be used for cruises during the lean winter months .

"She had , she said , heard that the plant was closing ."
"And now , the woman , tired and trembling , came here to the DeKalb County cannery ."
`` Is it so the cannery is going to close '' ? ?
He did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this summer .
A three-man committee has recommended to Commission Chairman Charles O. Emmerich that the DeKalb County cannery be closed .
"Moss , a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county , doesn't believe it will close ."
"But he is in the middle , an employe of DeKalb , but on the side of the people ."
"`` Don't ask me if I think the cannery helps '' , he said ."
Most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard .
a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge .
I know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades .
"Henry Van Dyke said , `` Forgive and forget if you can ; ;"
It also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past .
"Finally , we must be willing to forgive others as many times as they sin against us ."
"Once Peter asked , `` How oft shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? ?"
`` How do you know you love somebody enough to get married '' ? ?

Mr. Podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at Loon Lake .
The narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure .
"In the midst of it all , Mr. Podger came out on the Pod porch , alone ."
"He had that day attended a country auction , and he had come back with a prize ."
He closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him .
"`` But '' , it said , `` do you always know when you're happy '' ? ?"
"The voice sank back into the general tangle of sound , but the question stayed in Mr. Podger's mind ."
"The winging spread of blue had gone on , calling harshly , into the wood ."
The small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet .
Would a blue feather in a man's hat make him happy all day ? ?
"Then , since the auction was being held nearby , he had walked to it ."
The turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon .
But Mr. Podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other .
For a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama .
"`` I like them things , too '' , he had said ."
"Mr. Podger had thanked him gravely , and now he made use of the advice ."
Desegregation is beginning in two more important Southern cities -- Dallas and Atlanta .
They point out simply that `` it is the law of the land '' .
"Even better , they have the examples of Nashville and Houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs ."
"It is a `` stair-step '' plan , in which desegregation begins in the first grade ."
Another attempt will be made this year in New Orleans to resume the program .
Perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in Dallas .
"During the summer , Negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments ."
"Hotels , for example , are ready to let down the bars ."
"Already , at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis ."
Several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis .
It is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the South .
Business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence .
They are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order .
In the past these same Southerners were inclined to look the other way .
"And as the businessmen have begun to act , a real sense of co-operation has sprung up ."
This co-operation has emboldened other Southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation .
"Played mostly on the freeways around Los Angeles , it goes like this :"
The adjacent driver in Lane B has three choices open to him .
"Whether or not this is done out of enlightened self-preservation , I don't know ."
"But it is done , consistently and I'm both surprised and impressed ."
There such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood .
"Failing this , he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly ."
"This negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways , however , does an injustice to Southern California drivers ."
"Now Richards , of course , is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go ."
"He can often make the complex ridiculously simple , and vice versa ."
"This happened to be vice versa , but even so , the answer was a masterpiece ."
And with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher .
"`` Now , if I can just figure out what he's talking about , I'll use it '' ."
This angle of just where the Orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one .
You certainly can't expect the infield to do any better than it did last year .
"Hansen will be getting a late spring training start , which might very well set him back ."
"He got off to an exceptional start last season , and under the circumstances probably won't duplicate it ."
There are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year .
"They don't expect to stop him , just slow him down some with the bat ."
Richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season .
"Triandos hasn't proved it yet , but he says he's convinced his thumb is all right ."
"To me , Brandt looks as though he could be in for a fine year ."
"He hasn't played too much , because Richards has been working on him furiously in batting practice ."
"He was down , hard to talk to , and far too nonchalant on the field ."
"And Walker looks stronger , seems to be throwing better than he did last year ."
"Let him bounce back , and he could really set up the staff ."
"So , if the Orioles are to improve , Brandt , Triandos and Walker will have to do it ."
So far the platoons on left and right fielders don't seem capable of carrying the load .
Is the mother of an `` autistic '' child at fault ? ?
( The `` autistic '' child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self .
Sometimes she can -- to a large extent -- help him overcome them .
"We don't think she can make her child defective , emotionally disturbed or autistic ."
"This is that autistic people don't enjoy physical contact with others -- for instance , my children and I ."
He pushes and straightens himself as if he can't stand the feeling of being held .
"As a rule , the autistic child doesn't enjoy physical contact with others ."
"For the young child this may be no more than providing food , light or movement ."
Or certain words or rituals that child and adult go through may do the trick .
"The answer is different for each autistic child , but for most there is an answer ."
"`` Dear Doctors : We learned this year that our older son , Daniel , is autistic ."
"We did not accept the diagnosis at once , but gradually we are coming to ."
What I do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible .
Is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits ? ?
This immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature for the first grade .
"You sometimes give them a little demonstration , a little guidance , and suggestions about staying inside the lines ."
But most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only a very little demonstration .
Seen in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest in an old art : embroidery .
Their meeting at San Francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the California Democratic Council directorate .
"Where only one club existed before , he says , two will flourish henceforth ."
"Biggest organizational problem , he adds , is setting up CDC units in rock-ribbed Democratic territory ."
"Naturally , the statewide races will provide the major test for the expanding council ."
There is evidence that it will be happily received by Gov. Brown and the other constitutional incumbents .
But the rest of the GOP gubernatorial aspirants don't worry him very much .
"This is going to be a language lesson , and you can master it in a few minutes ."
"It works with English , Russian , German , Hungarian or almost any other foreign tongue ."
"Once you learn how to translate Communese , much of each day's deluge of news will become clearer ."
They accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves are most guilty .
Then the Communese reply came back from many mouthpieces with striking consistency .
The Soviet news agency TASS datelined from New York in English to Europe :

Sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but kind to the feet .
"That is why it is important to invest in comfortable , airy types of shoes ."
Many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness achieved via unlined leathers .
Styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape .
Wine glass heels are to be found in both high and semi-heights .
Just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage pumps .
"In the tintable group are high and little heels , squared and oval throats , and shantung-like textures ."
In the casual field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved wood in a variety of styles .

The same can be said of shaving yet the electric razor has proved useful to many men .
"The electric toothbrush moves in a vertical direction , the way dentists recommend ."
The bristles are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel .
Several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented with the device .
"But for many of us , it will prove an enjoyable luxury ."
It is not as convenient as the old type toothbrush and the paste tends to shimmy off the bristles .
"Since the apparatus is new , it requires experimentation and changes in technique ."
This is a common symptom and the cause usually is pressure on the nerve leading to the affected hand .
"The pressure may come from muscles , tendons , or bones anywhere from the neck to the hand ."
"No , other than cleaning out the pores and making the sweat glands work harder ."

It won't develop until he has words with which to clothe it .
The fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be .
She should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child .
"If he can't play with Mommy's magazines , he should have some old numbers of his own ."
If Daddy's books are out of bounds his own picture books are not .
Toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove .
During this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the child's conscience .
"If he bites a playmate she says , `` Danny won't like you '' ."
Substitute approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act .
They seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes .

The task force might make a start in Washington with Republican congressional leaders .
The people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery .
"Smokers reduced to `` the makings '' , spoke of the sack tobacco as `` Hoover dust '' ."
One may be sure the present Republican congressional leadership hasn't meant to repeat this error .
"If they also defeat the school bill , the GOP task force won't have much research to do ."
It will early know why the party won't win back city votes .
The tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner .
Hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever .
How unpartisan will be the recommendations of Lt. Gov. Garland Byrd's Senate Committee on Government Operations ? ?
The Georgia State Chamber of Commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates .
It wanted the State Democratic Executive Committee to pick the `` serious candidates '' .
"But State Party Chairman James Gray of Albany said no , and he didn't mince any words ."

This land is in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town .
The demand for these lots can be met for some time to come .
It is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs .
As this tax base grows so then can your medium and low density residential areas grow .

Then people wonder why Russian pupils are more advanced than American students .
"However , the East Providence Rescue Squad made its way through to my home in time of desperation ."
Words cannot tell of the undivided attention and comfort their service gave to me .
The rescue squad is to be praised immensely for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather .
Usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page .
"It can manifest itself before discharge from service , or it can come out years later ."
I believe in priority for service-connected disabled veterans in admission to VA hospitals .
But I don't believe we should close the door on non-service-connected patients .
Some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long .
"First of all , the admitting physician in the VA hospital gets the patient as a new patient ."
"If the doctor is conscientious , he wants to study the patient ."
So he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery .
The American public must be presented with the facts concerning VA hospitalization .
It seems that open season upon veterans' hospitalization is once more upon us .
"Nevertheless , we wonder at the stand of the A.M.A. on the health problem confronting the aged ."
What does he think a remark like this `` lousy '' one does to our prestige and morale ? ?
Why should Congress even consider allowing such a sum for that which can give no protection ? ?
"Let us prepare for peace , instead of for a war which would mean the end of civilization ."
It looks more like they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering themselves .
High school students have more sense of the way to dress than college students .
"Many high school students go past my house every day , and they look like perfect ladies and gentlemen ."

"Douglas has consistently voted to aid the people who killed Masaryk , and against principles Masaryk died to uphold ."

Recently the secretary of the Friends Committee on National Legislation was interviewed on the air .
"While I respect his sincere concern for peace , he made four points that I would like to question ."
"He said , `` Let's work for peace instead of protection from aggression '' ."
war is the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people .
"As to protection , the speaker disapproved of shelters , pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone ."
The speaker suggested that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face .
"Lastly , the speaker decried our organized program of emergency help calling it `` Civilian Defense '' ."

Let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens .
The United States and Soviet Russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations .
I have just returned from a seven-week trip to Europe and the Far East .
It is quite evident that the people of Western Europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war .
"The fact is that the Italians , French and British know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs ."
We should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into Berlin .
It would be criminal folly if the Communists tried to prevent us .
But there is nothing we can do to stop Soviet Russia from granting de facto recognition to East Germany .
Soviet Russia has been invaded twice by German troops in a generation .
In the last war Russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories were devastated .
The truth is that Communist Russia fears the resurgence of German militarism .
It could provide security without cost of armaments and increase German prosperity and lessen taxation .
If the German people favor such a settlement we should not oppose Germany following the example of Austria .
"They are violating their Charter obligation , the prescribed penalty for which is suspension of membership or expulsion '' ."
I would like to quote from the Charter of the United Nations :
The General Assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the Organization .
The expenses of the Organization shall be borne by the Members as apportioned by the General Assembly .
The U.S.S.R. and her followers are careful in paying their obligations to the regular budget .

Thank you for the article by George Sokolsky on the public apathy to impudence .
Why has this form of gentility gone out of American life ? ?
Writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of `` modern '' parents they have observed .
I commend Senator Hart for his brave fight to establish a national park in the dunes area .
Maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a `` ghost '' town .
Without these massive trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future .
"There are lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates , but not for the dropouts ."
"What we need is more vocational training in high schools , not more dropouts ."
I am referring to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because Russia is .
Will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less harmful to future generations of children ? ?
Just to remind the Communists that the bombs dropped on Japan were to end a war not start one .
The war could have continued many years with many thousands killed on both sides .
Russia has showed its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the world .
One of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea .
We shuffle a large percentage of the cars across the river twice .
"Bridges , tunnels and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings ."
"Each one of these is , by its nature , a focal point or a point of natural congestion ."
So widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems .
Paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges .
Replace it with the statue of one or another of the world's famous dictators .
"It may remind one of Russia , China or East Berlin ; ;"

"If birds don't belong in a Square or Park , what does ? ?"

"Starlings and blackbirds are scared off by canon , from City Hall ."
There is a trend today to bemoan the fact that Americans are too `` soft '' .
"Unfortunately , those who would remedy our `` softness '' seek to do so with calisthenics ."
It is not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft .
"America doesn't need to `` push-up '' , she needs to stand up ! !"
The area most prominently commented on during the McClellan hearings had to do with `` sweetheart contracts '' .
These arrangements would have been impossible if the business community was truly interested in the welfare of its employes .
"And now , of course , the hue and cry for counter-escalation is being raised on our side ."
"`` Only a discontinuity can end it '' , Professor Morrison writes ."
"`` The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy '' ."
"If this capacity had not failed them , they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation ."

"Not terror , but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the Soviet sphere ."
"When one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another , it is only natural ."
"They are less vocal now , when it is the West Berliners who are migrating ."
"West Berlin morale is low and , in age distribution , the situation is unfavorable ."
Whole families are moving and removal firms are booked for months ahead .
Another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from Bonn in The Observer ( London ) .
Mark Arnold-Foster writes : `` People are leaving ( West Berlin ) because they think it is dying .
"A compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph , but it will save Berlin ."
"Or the city can be a graveyard monument to Western intransigence , if that is what the West wants ."
"It is , in fact , a relatively mild chastisement of the dead ."
"And in England , after the Restoration , the body of Cromwell was disinterred and hanged at Tyburn ."
"Nikita Khrushchev , however , has created yet another problem for himself ."
"Who , then , is of sufficient stature to lodge with Lenin ? ?"
"Suppose he did lie beside Lenin , would it be permanent ? ?"
"When a man is laid to rest , he is entitled to stay put ."
"If Nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery , everyone will understand ."
"He has , moreover , another qualification which augurs well for the future ."
"Mr. Khrushchev's demand for a troika is dormant , not dead ; ;"
the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that U Thant represents .
"In a sense , the showdown promised by Mr. Hammarskjold's sudden and tragic death has been avoided ; ;"
No one who has studied the radical Right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade .
"they are also trained with carbines , automatic weapons , pistols , rifles and other such ladies' accessories ."
The country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means .
The official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms ; ;
Soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are in our midst .
"Here , then , is what Swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning ."
"so , all things considered , the highway commissioners would seem to be elected ."
"As it descends , the concentration of radioactivity builds up in the human body ; ;"
for a dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies .
The effect of radiation is cumulative over the years -- and on to succeeding generations .
"Shock , dismay and foreboding for future generations were legitimate reactions ; ;"
All of which makes it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood .
"Most of these would be in the Northern Hemisphere , where the fallout is concentrating ."
Its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing .
To this day the Atomic Energy Commission shies away from discussing the health aspects of fallout .
It could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations .
Only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder .
"one which , should it fail , will not have contaminated the conscience ."
For that is the one an increasingly large number of prominent Americans are now proposing .
Too often in the past Russian tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part .
With good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided Christendom .
"Equally significant , Pope John has said that Catholics themselves bear some responsibility for Christian disunity ."
Nor can one forget Pope John's unprecedented meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury .
"Furthermore , we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying than reassuring ."
The party that won used to say something about a New Frontier .
Usually questions from the floor were directed to the non-Catholic speaker or discussion leader .
"Speakers declared that Protestants often make use of it , if , perhaps , by some other name ."
The stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences was undeniable .
the pervasive influence of ideology on our political judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account ; ;
it is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the Christian imperative .
"I was searching for an accent of self-delusion or , even , of hypocrisy ."
"Their answer was : it can be done , and we will do it ."
"( He always smiles -- at least at visitors , I gather ."

"For every person on Taiwan , there are sixty in Mainland China ."
"They think , perforce , of physical survival : everything else is secondary ."

"The psychological strategists in Taiwan stress the great sense of family , cultivated in China over thousands of years ."
"Every soldier in the army has , somewhere , relatives who are close to starvation ."

"The first was the commune program , which will ensure agricultural poverty for years ."
"but the government is left with no reserve granary , under the agricultural system it has ordained ."
China never tried to integrate Tibet by extirpating the people's religion and institutions .
"Red China is trying to do this , and she is not likely ever to succeed ."
They know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control .
"First and foremost , they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the Communist regime ."
"Secondly , they depend on America's `` moral cooperation '' when the crucial moment arrives ."
"They hope that if history vouchsafes the West another Budapest , we will receive the opportunity gladly ."
"But our outlook has been , and continues to be , defensive ."
A great deal depends on the crystallization of Mr. Kennedy's views on the world struggle .
"The Free Chinese know that the situation on the Mainland is in flux , and are poised to strike ."
There is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized force for liberation .
"There the truth is , open to eyes that are willing to look ."
"The measure was instantly taken , as always in such cases , of public men at many levels ."
"One knows better , now , who has bone and who has jelly in his spine ."
Of course the fighting was officially under the auspices of the United Nations .
But in the moment of truth everyone could see that the U.S. was in reality the principal .
at the peaks of the nuclear test and the Berlin cycles ; ;
"right now , with almost cartoon emphasis , in the temporally linked complex of Tshombe-Gizenga-Goa-Ghana ."
There is even some question whether the U.S. can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the Left .
No matter that it is his troops who rape Western women and eat Western men .
No matter that the Katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of Western interests in Africa .
"We can mass our fleet against the Trujillos , but not against the Castros ."
And it becomes clear why in general we cannot take the initiative against the Left .
"Nowadays , more and more , all he needs is someone else's book ."
"To get started , he does not scan the world about him ; ;"
"Advise And Consent , lively but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed bestseller ; ;"
"Face Of A Hero ( closed ) , based on a Pierre Boulle novel ."
"Some memorable plays have been drawn from books , notably Life With Father and Diary Of Anne Frank ."
"And other defenders invariably argue that , after all , Shakespeare and Moliere were adapters too ."
"Off-Broadway , where production is still comparatively cheap , is proving itself only slightly more original ."
The real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of U.S. playwrights .
"between performances , enthusiastic young men from the audience will take the floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces ."
"Except for the odd uptown sex maniac or an overeager Greek sailor , the people watch in calm absorption ."
"the darbuka , a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass ; ;"
But a great many of what Variety calls the `` Cooch Terpers '' are considerably less cosmic than that .
But a great many of the dancers are more or less native .
"Many belly dancers are married , but Serene is one of the few who will admit it ."
"But the ships are very slow now , and we don't get so many sailors any more '' ."
The critics' campaign finally inspired the first major U.S. exhibit of Schiele's works .
"The show has been to Boston and Manhattan , will in time reach Pittsburgh and Minneapolis ."
"His people ( see color ) are angular and knobby-knuckled , sometimes painfully stretched , sometimes grotesquely foreshortened ."
"His colors are dark and murky , and his landscapes and cityscapes seem swallowed in gloom ."
Gradually Schiele evolved a somber style of his own -- and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter .
His pictures were roundly denounced as `` the most disgusting things one has ever seen in Vienna '' .
"Drafted into the Austrian army , he rebelliously rejected discipline , wangled a Vienna billet , went on painting ."
It was not until the last year of his life that he had his first moneymaking show .
"He was obsessed by disease and poverty , by the melancholy of old age and the tyranny of lust ."
there might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from .
Over all these fairly awkward problems Khrushchev was to skate rather lightly ; ;
This was something on which K. himself seemed to have some doubts ; ;
for he kept on threatening that he would `` pull the ears '' of those responsible for agricultural production .
"And , as we know , the Virgin Lands are not producing as much as Khrushchev had hoped ."
"in fact , with having been against all the more popular features of the Khrushchev `` welfare state '' ."
These seem about the only two ways in which the `` unhappy incident '' can now be closed .
But Albania is merely a symptom of a real malaise between China and Russia .
"To these people , solidarity and unity with China should be the real basis of Russia's future policy ."
He seems strong enough inside the party to cope with any internal opposition ; ;
"To the average American , this must sound like an incredible tale from a Saturday night TV movie ."
They feel that the United States is engaged in a life-and-death struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy .
The mortar was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated .
"Here the two leaders , DePugh and Lauchli , hastened to put the group through its paces ."
They were shown how to advance against an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge .
They practiced movement behind a smoke screen laid by smoke grenades ; ;
and they attempted a skirmish line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment .
Eleven dummy rounds were fired by Lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire mortar shooting .
The amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers .
"as a result buyers , the public , must be satisfied with second-rate teachers ."
It follows that teachers as a group cannot expect any marked salary increases ; ;
there is a limit to how much the public will pay for shoddy performance .
For him to ignore the political consequences involved in an Atlantic Union of this kind is difficult to understand .
"He says : `` It has swept aside petty nationalisms , age-old rivalries , and worn-out customs '' ."
Listen to what Mr. Johnston has to say : `` Consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict .
We would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports we need .
"We would be crippled by reduced output , industrial decline , widespread unemployment '' ."
"If we want to preserve our sovereignty , this is the way to do it ; ;"
"Now , more than five years later , I cannot in any realistic sense be called a trained soldier ."
"In my own case , I submit that such reasonable and fair exercise is woefully lacking ."
In news broadcasts I consistently hear the foreign volunteers fighting in the Katanga Army referred to as mercenaries .
If the UN troops are not mercenaries then the Hessians were not mercenaries either .
"At least in Indonesia , Khrushchev found an American proud to be at total war with Communism '' ! !"
I found recently a very small article in the New York Times :
"-- Indonesia Military Supreme Court has confirmed the death sentence passed on Alan Lawrence Pope , an American pilot ."
Pope was convicted last year of having aided North Celebes rebels by flying bombing missions .
The Eleanor Roosevelt Tractor Committee acts on behalf of the Cuban freedom fighters .
But who will act now and immediately to save the life of Alan Pope ? ?
Does anybody think of saving the life of an anti-Communist American pilot ? ?
"`` With no strong men and no parliament to dispute his will , he was the government '' ."
"`` He opened his mouth , said little , and thought not at all '' ."
"This affects us all intimately , and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress ."
I feel that N.C. hit the very core of our existence in the editorial `` Confrontation '' .
"my only hope is that it will be shared by many , many others ."
"`` Confrontation '' should fortify us all , whether in Southeast Asia or the U.S. ."
Congratulations to N.C. for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the Peace Corps .
I concur that it is necessary for Americans to have a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands .
The editorial `` Confrontation '' was certainly direct in its appeal to those of us living here in America .
Thanks for continuing to capture the attention and uncover so many areas of need in this amazing world .
I would hope that Sargent Shriver will encourage everyone entering the Peace Corps to read it .
The charges by the late junior Senator from Wisconsin not only destroyed innocent people but misled the nation .
Yet the press was powerless to put these charges in perspective in its news columns .
"To begin with , the all-powerful Los Angeles Times does not publish a transcript of these press conferences ."
The radio stations did run `` transcripts '' ( I thought ) during the evening hours .
We out here don't see enough of the conference to know he is being abused .
I don't know if this is the situation in other parts of the country ; ;
"There were also a couple in Canada , and several in England ."
"We set up the Lloyd's Neck school , worked out its curriculum , and taught there ."
A study at the Pentagon and at the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there .
Congratulations on the article `` Do We Need A College Of Propaganda '' ? ?
One should be able to get hold of the book at once .
Until the work actually appears I am not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail .
The text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the prepublication excerpt .
It calls the conclusion admitted valid by `` historians and military strategists alike '' a `` perverted conclusion .
The only fact that holds any weight in the article is the result of the tea party .
"If so , I would lean to Sir Charles' conception of the man ."
I think it was a grave error to print the article at this time .
It is not news that Nathan Milstein is a wizard of the violin .
"There was about that song something incandescent , for this Brahms was Milstein at white heat ."
Those would be reserved for the orchestra's great nights when the soloist can surpass himself .
This time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood .
But he had in Walter Hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point .
"So we had some dazzling and memorable Milstein , but not great Brahms ."
Remember how by a series of booking absurdities Chicago missed seeing the Bolshoi Ballet ? ?
Remember how by lack of two big theaters Chicago missed the first visit of the Royal Danish Ballet ? ?
"But if you keep a calendar of events , as we do , you noticed a conflict ."
Then why not the juicy booking Hurok had held for us ? ?
"Queried about the impasse , Allied Arts said : `` Better cancel the Kirov for the time being ."
"H E. Bates has scribbled a farce called `` Hark , Hark , The Lark '' ! !"
It is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season .
"If there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans , it is hard to find ."
"That's not precisely the way Larkin urges them to look at it , though ."
"He conjures herds of deer , and wild birds crowding the air ."
He suggests that Gore Court embodies all the glories of Tudor splendor .
"Also , perhaps , table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented ."
"One of those capital-gains ventures , in fact , has saddled him with Gore Court ."
He is willing to sell it just to get it off his hands .
They plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox's life on earth .
Mr. Bates shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc .
"Cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do ."
"He treats this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect ."
"Since Russian was being spoken instead of Spanish , there is no violation of artistry or logic here ."
"As a matter of fact , this latter approach has already been tried , and with pleasing results ."
The program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music .
"Cameras stared at soloists' faces in extreme closeups , then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work ."
`` Chicago And All That Jazz '' could not be faulted on the choice of artists .
NBC had gathered a lot of historical material which it was eager to share .
"This big , flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined ."
"In the fullness of her vocal splendor , however , she could sing the famous scene magnificently ."
"Technically it was fascinating , aurally spell-binding , and dramatically quite realistic ."
"Her debut over , perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine ."
"The performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor , Silvio Varviso ."
He injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years .
She will sing `` La Sonambula '' with it here next week .
All of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program .
This is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound .
"Drums , xylophones , castanets , and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably well ."
"Many Hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic , but not realistic ."
"Strange , but true -- authenticity and realism often aren't related at all ."
"Almost every film bearing the imprimatur of Hollywood is physically authentic -- in fact , impeccably so ."
The major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this matter .
"But , alas , the authenticity seems to stop at the set's edge ."
He intimated that they weren't doing the country much good in the Cold War .
"And to an industry that prides itself on authenticity , he urged greater realism ."
"His pianist was Donald Jenni , a faculty member at DePaul University ."
"In vying with him , Mr. D'Albert also seemed to be overdriving his tone ."
"Mr. D'Albert has a firm , attractive tone , which eschews an overly sweet vibrato ."
"They might well indicate conjugal felicity , but in musical terms that smack of Hollywood ."
The second half of her program was devoted to Russian composers of this century .
"The four Kabalevsky Preludes were also assured , rich in color and songful ."
And the Prokofieff Seventh Sonata had the combination of romanticism and modern bravura that Prokofieff needs .
"So , what was the deepest music on her program had the poorest showing ."
Miss Xydis was best when she did not need to be too probing .
And the best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written .
"It is `` Defeat Into Victory '' , by Field Marshal Viscount Slim ."
"The man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is , of course , the Field Marshal himself ."
"He returned in command of an international army of Gurkhas , Indians , Africans , Chinese and British ."
"Field Marshal Slim is striking in description , amusing in many anecdotes ."
`` Defeat Into Victory '' is a dramatic and lively military narrative .
"His remarks about training , discipline , morale , leadership and command are enlightening ."
He believed in making inspiring speeches and he made a great many .
He believed in being seen near the front lines and he was there .
"administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with Top Brass -- British , American and Chinese ; ;"

"Their singing was well-balanced , clear and , within obvious limitations , extremely pleasing ."
"Most surprising of all , he has accomplished some prodigies in training for the production of words ."
"Furthermore , there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation of the music ."
A boy soprano named Dixon Boyd sang a Durante solo motet and a few other passages enchantingly .
"Other capable soloists included David Clifton , Joseph Schockler and Pat Thompson ."
"The material is all basically of folk origin , gleaned from every section of Poland ."
The girls are charming children and the men are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters .

"The Theatre-by-the-Sea , Matunuck , presents `` King Of Hearts '' by Jean Kerr and Eleanor Brooke ."
"John Heffernan , playing Larry Larkin , the cartoonist , carries the show in marvelous fashion ."
Not that Mr. Hedison does not make the most of his role .
"But the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist , and it has to be that way ."
"And for his playmate , Francis Coletta of West Warwick , who has a bit part , Billy ."
"It is a tremendous book , lively , constantly moving , and the Matunuck cast does well by it ."
"Furthermore , he's something of a scoundrel , an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips ."
They not only think and feel cliches but live cliches as well .
"It is awfully talky , for instance , and not all of the talk is terribly impressive ."
But it strikes sparks on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten .
It is greatly to Berman's credit that he made no attempt to outdo Ray Bolger .
The costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous gowns and picture hats of the Gibson Girl days .
The Broadway Theater League of Rhode Island presents C. Edwin Knill's and Martin Tahse's production of `` Fiorello ! !
"Then Rudy Bond was simply grand as Ben , the distraught Republican Party district chieftain ."
"Jen Nelson , as Thea , his first wife , managed to make that short role impressive ."
all the words of its clever lyrics came through with perfect clarity .
Martin Tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions .
I'm glad to say there's none of that distraction in this `` Fiorello ! !
The answers the girls give struck me as reasonably varied and healthily individual .
`` Where The Boys Are '' also has a juvenile bounce that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy .
"Most of the female faces are new , or at least not too familiar ."
"Dolores Hart , is charming in a leading role , and quite believable ."
"A couple of the males made good comedy , too -- Jim Hutton and Frank Gorshin ."
The superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of William James was never more evident than in his letters .
Here was a man with an enormous gift for living as well as thinking .
`` The best condition of it would be an open conflict and rivalry of the diverse systems .
"The world might ring with the struggle , if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other '' ."
"To James this vision never quite came , despite his appreciation of it in others ."
`` The Tyranny Of Trivia '' suggests arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber .
Or the mildly epigrammatic utterance ( also a quotation ) : `` Woman's place is in the wrong '' .
Who but Thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences ? ?

) who first conceived the startling fancy of a picture window in the abdomen .
"That is , it is literally a picture window : you don't see into the viscera ; ;"
"This is something like what Thurber's best effects are like , if I am not mistaken ."
But there is a difference between the present volume and the early Low .
There is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings show .
"And the leading issue , that of piecemeal aggression , remains the same ."
we are stronger and more self-confident -- and Low cannot so easily put us to rights .
It might be that Low has seen too many stupidities and that they do not outrage him now .
"Whatever the cause , his mood in the fifties rarely rises above the level of the capably sardonic ."
He does not seem to have caught the subtleties of the man .
The skies turn dark but the clouds do not loose their wrath .
Did Low decide to let well enough alone when he made his selections ? ?
And Khrushchev turned out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all .
Look in this book for weak mortals and only on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale .
"The fox is all ingratiating smiles when he arrives from New Orleans , accompanied by one wharf rat ."
( The followers of bullies invariably are aggrieved about the very things they plan to do to others .
He may have a point in urging that decadent themes be given fewer prizes .
Mr. Kennan sums up his judgment of what went wrong this way :
They were blind to the evidence that nothing could keep the Russian people fighting .
They attributed everything that went wrong in Russia to German influence and intrigue .
"This , more than any other factor , led to the fiasco of Allied intervention ."
The scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated by Communist propaganda ; ;
"here Kennan , operating with precise facts and figures , performs an excellent job of debunking ."
"`` This was a man of incredible criminality , of a criminality effectively without limits ; ;"
"a man apparently foreign to the very experience of love , without mercy or pity ; ;"
a man whose hand was set against all that could not be useful to him at the moment ; ;
a man who was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators in crime .
"So Enright's courting of the mettlesome Ellen is impeded considerably , thereby providing the tale which is told ."
"Then there is a matchmaker , one Mikeen Flynn , a role for which Eddie Foy was happily selected ."
"Mr. Foy is a joy , having learned his dancing by practicing it until he is practically perfect ."
"If the mettle which Ellen exhibits has a bit of theatrical dross in it , never mind ; ;"
"She has a good , firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues of the evening ."
"The ballads are sweet and sad , and the music generally competent ."
The male dancers sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and stimulating .

"Their collaboration in the Beethoven Second Symphony was lucid , intelligent and natural sounding ."
"The music sang nicely , sprinted evenly when necessary , was properly accented and balanced ."
"Fortunate for the music itself , it is not too frequent a visitor ; ;"
"if it were , its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying ."
Mr. Paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic elements of the score .
"He did not let the strings , for instance , weep , whine or get hysterical ."
"Mr. Skolovsky's approach to the concerto was bold , sweeping and tonally percussive ."
"He swept through the music with ease , in a non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner ."
"An impressive technician , Mr. Skolovsky has fine rhythm , to boot ."
A school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this concerto needs .
and the composer himself was called the `` age of steel pianist '' .
"Taken as a whole , though , it was a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra ."
This was composed last year as a salute to the automobile industry .
"It runs a little more than ten minutes , is workmanlike , busy , methodical and featureless ."

The English have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better than anyone else .
The elements of elegance and color in Jannequin are strong French characteristics .

"All these records have close , attractive sound and the performances by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic ."
"The strange , delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious ."
"Each might find a useful place in a varied musical program , but taken together they grew quite tiresome ."
Selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos and duets in a broad range of languages .
"There was , therefore , more musical substance in the concert than might have been the case otherwise ."
"The poor uneducated newlywed , a certain Gontran De Boismassif , has his problems in getting the necessary information ."
"What a silly , artificial way of life , Chabrier and his librettists chuckle ."
"The simple , clever production was also able to tread the thin line between those extremes ."

She frosted the cake with the always reliable `` Bill Bailey '' .
"In this he is sticking with tradition , however far removed from it he may seem to be ."
"Shearing , himself , seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent Newport appearances ."
He has been on previous Newport programs and was one of the sensations of last year's afternoon concerts .
Pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know the interesting material contained in Schubert's Sonatas .
Perhaps one of the reasons these Sonatas are not programmed more often is their great length .

Nor did the dancing involved really seize the attention at any time .
"The music here , Russell Smith's `` Tetrameron '' , sounded good ."
Mr. Cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a Chopin Nocturne .

-- The performances of the Comedie Francaise are the most important recent events in the New York theater .
"In France , novel approaches to the classic French plays are frequently attempted ."
perhaps that is the Comedie's equivalent for thrusting this play's characters into our own time .
"by that time , he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy ."
one influential French critic remarked : `` Pity for Arnolphe comes with age '' .
But the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the play became only comedy acted rather slowly .
"His red face , his coarse gestures , and his lustful stares bespeak his sensuality ."
But his heavenward glances and his pious speeches are not merely perfunctory ; ;
"Occasionally , Seigner draws some justly deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another ."
"His normal specialty is playing the good-natured old man , frequently stupid or deluded but never mean or sly ."
"Here , he is , quite persuasively , the very embodiment of meanness and slyness ."
"Seigner is the dean of the company , the oldest actor in point of continuous service ."
"In that function , he helps to rebut another legend about the Comedie ."
"Seigner , however , is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the company ; ;"

There is hardly a jazz guitarist in the business today who doesn't owe something to Django .
Most of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep with a cigarette .

What might have been only warmed-over topical journalism turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history .

Few artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they lived .
Few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with so little bitterness .
Obviously Sloan's early years were influenced by his close friend Robert Henri .

Using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with Shakespeare's words in a spirited mixture .
The audience filled all the seats inside the Wollman enclosure and overflowed onto the lawns outside the fence .
"At first hardly a person in the audience moved , although some umbrellas were opened ."
"But the rain came more heavily , and men and women in light summer clothes began to depart ."
"The grieving Hero and her father , Leonato , followed by the Friar , left the stage ."
"Some remained in the Wollman enclosure , fortified with raincoats or with newspapers to cover their heads ."
Beatrice ( Nan Martin ) and Benedick ( J. D. Cannon ) took their places on the stage .

"Replied Beatrice : `` Yea , and I will weep a while longer '' ."
The Parks Department has done an admirable job of preparing the Wollman Rink for Shakespeare .
But what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism .
"Clever light songs were overly coy , tragic songs a little too melodramatic ."
"There were stunning musical phrases too , and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication ."
All the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills ; ;
"Their props were two stepladders , a chair and a palm fan ."

"`` A writer lives , at best , in a state of astonishment '' , he says ."

He can coin a neat phrase : `` a street spattered with an invigoration of people '' ; ;
tulips with `` petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel's ears '' ; ;
after a snowstorm a landscape smelling `` of woodsmoke and clarity '' .
How far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence Mr. Sansom reminds us thus :
"`` Blue Skies , Brown Studies '' is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs ."
"Yesterday it offered `` Poised For Violence '' , by Jean Reavey ."
"Unfortunately , `` Poised For Violence '' was not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point ."
Somewhere in Mrs. Reavey's play there is both protest and aspiration of merit .

"Hazards to life and limb on the golf course , while existent , are actuarially insignificant ."
A Clerfayt may moon on about the face of Death in the cockpit ; ;
"In contrast , the East is ably led by such stalwart heroes as Khrushchev , Tito , and Mao ."
"With this barrage , Montgomery of Alamein launches his attack upon the blunderings of the West ."
"With Britain looking inward , overseas problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the United States ."
`` America gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike '' .
The net result is that under American leadership the general world situation has become bad .
As faulty as has been our leadership clearly the United States must be relied upon to lead .
Montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the West's own house in order .
"Such a leader must strengthen NATO politically , and establish that true unity about which it has always talked ."
but the East would have to show sincerity in carrying it out '' .
`` But where is the leader who will handle all these things for us '' ? ?
Montgomery knew all the national leaders up to the time of Kennedy .
The man whom he would select as our leader for this great task is De Gaulle .
"He alone has the wisdom , the conviction , the tenacity , and the courage to reach a decision ."
But De Gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring France's lost soul .
"All in all , Montgomery calls for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him ."
"Nevertheless , Montgomery has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the Western world ."
It suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership .
"Through previous centuries , eating changed by nearly imperceptible degrees , and mostly toward just getting enough ."
"Refrigeration , automated processing and packaging conspire to defy season and banish spoilage ."
"To eat is human , the nation is learning to think , to survive divine ."
Grocery stores sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all .
"Keys's findings , though far from complete , are likely to smash many an eating cliche ."
"And extra weight increases the risk of cancer , diabetes , artery disease and heart attack ."
"The deficiency diseases -- scurvy , tropical sprue , pellagra -- run rampant ."
"Puritan New England regarded obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance , and thus a sin ."
The fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to pay higher premiums .
"Physiologically , people overeat because what Dr. Jolliffe calls the `` appestat '' is set too high ."
"Far more frequently , overeating is the result of a psychological compulsion ."
The result says Jolliffe : `` The child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life '' .
"He may be interested in another woman , or just like being with the boys ."
So she fishes around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake .
But they cannot fully explain the process of its manufacture by the human liver .
"The proteins and fats are burned off , and the cholesterol is left behind ."
"All natural food fats fall into one of three categories -- saturated , mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated ."
The degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the fat molecule .
Just what is meant by `` spirit '' and by `` matter '' ? ?
Yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do .
One of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit .
Not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true .
The scientific debunking of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough .
Science has simply left us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our lives .
There is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people .
"Everyone in Salem , saint and sinner alike , is swept up by it ."
"I hear the boot of Lucifer , I see his filthy face '' ! !"
The reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author's convictions to the contrary .
There is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit .
"Think , for example , of the spirit of the Marine Corps ."
It is not material and is not a `` thing '' occupying space and time .
Yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known .
For it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit .
It is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere .
Yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community .
The idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable ideas .
The members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them .
It is for them a given which they and they alone possess .
This does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching .
The absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann's intention .
"In fact , it is in just such a situation that the profundity of Bultmann's argument is disclosed ."
This is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class .
But can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation ? ?
This is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition .
This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter .
"Modern man , as Dietrich Bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come of age '' ; ;"
and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it .
One hundred years ago there existed in England the Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom .
"For the `` tide is well on the turn '' , as the London Catholic weekly Universe has written ."
I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal Newman .
"As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; ;"
"Since arriving here , however , I have formed a far different religious picture of present-day England ."
The Protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches .
An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true .
Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy .
"With traditional nationalistic spirit , some Englishmen claim that English Catholicism is Catholicism at its best ."
I have found myself saying with other foreigners here that English Catholics are good Catholics .
Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students .
"The Catholic priest , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came out the best ."
Such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid-Victorian England .
The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass with commentary has been televised several times in recent months .
And it was interesting to observe that B.B.C.'s television film on Christmas Eve was The Bells Of St. Mary's .
"The death of a man is unique , and yet it is universal ."
"The straight line would symbolize its uniqueness , the circle its universality ."
Yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind .
"His history is his alone , yet each man must recognize his own history in it ."
"As represented by a spiral , history may , in some sense , be said to repeat itself ; ;"
The first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in Adam .
"`` Whence , then , comes the substance of the first man ? ?"
"Recent research on Irenaeus , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction ."
"These conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ; ;"
"He was , in the words of Irenaeus , `` beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality '' ."
"The true way to immortality lay through obedience , but man did not believe this ."
for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin .
he sees a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath .
"Even death , therefore , has a providential as well as a punitive function ."
for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ .
"Death reminds man of his sin , but it reminds him also of his transience ."
"These two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified ."
and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal .
"On the other hand , Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence ."
"It is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law ."
This seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced .
Such an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian view of creation ; ;
"for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and history ."
"Nevertheless , we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace ; ;"
"their passions were genuine , and the division between them and the abolitionists is clear-cut ."
"Opinion is less individual or runs more into masses , and often rules with a rod of iron '' ."
I think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons .
"An institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an institution , and only within those defined limits a license ."
"Test it , try it , and if it works , accept it as a guiding principle ."
"Our Lord's invitation with its implied promise to all is , `` Come and see '' ."
I stood at the bedside of my patient one day and beheld a very sick man in terrible pain .
"Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid '' ."
It is to those who believe on His name and belong to Him that He gives His peace ; ;
"not that empty peace the world offers , but a deep , abiding peace which nothing can destroy ."
"Then , with the hymn writer of old , you can say :"
"Cape Canaveral's achievements thunder forth from the radio , television , and newspaper ."

"Delinquency , juvenile and adult , is at an all-time high ! !"

It is true that we must keep up our national defenses and scientific accomplishments ; ;
Never forget that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link .
Your spiritual `` inner '' space helps determine the spirituality of America as a nation .
Or are you trying the devil's substitutes to relieve that spiritual hunger you feel within ? ?
A certain teacher scheduled a `` Fear Party '' for her fourth grade pupils .
"Dr. George W. Crane , a medical columnist , thinks it would ."
We are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to deal with the problem of fear these days .
Look at the things we do to escape our fears and to forget our worries .
We spend millions of dollars every year on fortune tellers and soothsayers .
"We spend billions of dollars at the race tracks , and more billions on other forms of gambling ."
"We spend billions of dollars on liquor , and many more billions on various forms of escapist entertainment ."
"He should have said `` jittery '' , for that's what we are ."
"Yes , and as tension mounts in this world , fear is increasing ."
Does that explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business ? ?
I doubt that `` fear parties '' and `` group confessionals '' will help very much .
"Suppose we do get our fears out in the open , what then ? ?"
Isn't that where most of them are already -- right out on the front page of our newspapers ? ?
The question is : what are we going to do about them ? ?
"Meanwhile , the enemy will capitalize on our fears , if he can ."
It is said that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes animals to attack .
"That is almost a perfect description of the predicament in which we find ourselves today , isn't it ? ?"
"Yes indeed , we too can see a warlike host of infidels encamped against us ."
"What a terrible thing , that `` wailing wall '' in Berlin ! !"
Practically everybody in Berlin has relatives and friends that live in the opposite part of the city .
But the enemy answers them from loudspeakers that pour out Communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible profanity .
These things may be happening many miles away from us but really they are right next door .
And there is only one way for a man to conquer his fears in such a world .
"He lived in a very dark world , but he was not in the dark ."
But this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism .
"Indeed , mathematically speaking , it was both functionally and symbolically the most important number in the entire diagram ."
These twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the Han dynasty .
"Later , we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally ."
"Together these two principles influenced all things , and in varying combinations they were present in everything ."
but in this respect it was merely following the accepted Chinese convention for all maps .
The same arrangement was used when the Lo Shu was equated with the Nine Provinces ; ;
"and whenever the Lo Shu involved directional symbolism , it was oriented in this same fashion ."
"These fatalities are dramatic evidence of `` halfway evangelism '' , a failure to follow through ."
The pastor and the Membership Preparation and Assimilation Committee must follow through immediately with a carefully planned program .
This is the answer to the problem of `` membership delinquency '' .
Some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported by the visitors .
The pastor calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance conference .
"If possible , he should make an appointment in order that all persons involved may be present ."
There may be problems of conduct or questions of belief which will require his counsel .
"A piece of devotional material , such as The Upper Room , may be left in each home ."
A minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary for adults .
Many churches find the Sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes .
"Others meet on Sunday night , at the mid-week service , or for a series of four nights ."
"Some pastors have two sessions in one evening , with a refreshment period between ."
This procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership packet .
An `` interest finder '' or `` talent sheet '' may be filled out by each person .
Ask each new member to bring his Pledge of Loyalty to the Reception Service .
Those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed .
The preparatory class is an introductory face-to-face group in which new members become acquainted with one another .
"This should be a high moment in their lives , a never-to-be-forgotten experience ."
"It can mean the difference between participation and inaction , spiritual growth and decay ."
The atmosphere for this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience .
Some denominations ask new members to sign personally the chronological membership register .
Arrange a reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together .
Invite sponsors or Fellowship Friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service .
"Introduce each new member to the congregation , asking him to face the congregation ."
Have a reception for new members in the parlor or social hall immediately after the service .
Every member of the family must have a vital place in its life .
Very easily they may be neglected and eventually join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive .
These figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership .
But this will not happen merely through the natural process of social life .
"Institutions require structure , form , and definition , and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion ."
Some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether ; ;
Yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at odds with their fellows .
"In a certain sense , interfaith communication parallels diplomatic communication among the nation-states ."
What are the pertinent facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history ? ?
"I shall touch on three areas : personal , national , and theological ."
"While the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial , nationalism is more variable ."
"Actually , however , this turns out to be only part of the picture ."
All this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural communication for which Christian missions stand .
"The people hardest hit by this suspicion are , of course , Christians on the mainland of China ."
"For example , in Burma and Ceylon many Buddhists argue that Buddhism ought to be the official state religion ."
I was seated next to the director of the Seventh Day Adventists' world radio program .
It was not that they had been contracted for during the interval ; ;
The partition of India has hardly improved relations between Hindus and Muslims ; ;
neither has the establishment of the State of Israel fostered harmony between Muslims and Jews .
The new regime in Turkey is intentionally less Muslim than its predecessor .
The religious parties in Israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months .
"Now that Israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction of tensions , the secularists are less disposed to compromise ."
"I mean , however , that the moral theologian knows what he means by `` permit '' ."
"He is not talking in the main about probabilities , risks and danger in general ."
"This is what , in a technical sense , to `` only permit '' an evil result means ."
He does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences of his action .
`` if it didn't prevail mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing '' ; ;
for `` surely anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war '' .
"Thus , moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality ; ;"
I do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war '' .
No political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature .
Toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment .
"This is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted , to the very last ; ;"
"The only contrary action , in the future as in the past , runs the risk of war ; ;"
This pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying their professional ethics ; ;
it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country .
What does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest ? ?
"What ought to be , what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change ? ?"
"Recently , a group of the faculty at Wesleyan University's Public Affairs Center sought some answers to these questions ."
Such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most realtors .
"Obviously , much more than customer expectation is determining the realtor's role ."
"Judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential buyers' income , educational level and above all , racial extraction ; ;"
The rationale for this avoidance was most frequently expressed in economic terms ; ;
From such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding .
"Also , it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employed ."
Often they are able to get in only because the area is declining economically .
Official reasoning : the bill was a `` wanton invasion of basic property rights '' .
"Thus , moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions ."
"Science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom ."
How can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge ? ?
That is enough TNT to fill the tower of the Empire State Building ; ;
"and with the availability of bombs of that size , war became a new problem ."
"Of course , there is also an optimistic side to the picture ."
"With just the hydrogen of our bodies , we could run the world for years ."
I have been trying to make this clear to my own class in chemistry .
I calculated first that there are about an octillion atoms in the average human body ; ;
Then I calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator ; ;
a billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic ; ;
a trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people ; ;
and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of Philadelphia .
"Imagine that there is a blizzard over Pennsylvania , but instead of snowing snow , it snows peas ; ;"
"so we get the whole state covered with peas , about four feet deep ."
Finally we go into the farthest reaches of the Milky Way ; ;
So you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are .
"Now although an atom is small , we can still in imagination have a look at it ."
I start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me .
"it also contains nearly all the mass , and the atomic energy ."
"You may ask what else there is , and the answer is nothing -- nothing but empty space ."
"And since you are made of atoms , you are nothing much but empty space , too ."
For we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics ; ;
and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts .
"So if you are made of atoms , you are just a big machine ; ;"
"and since the universe is also made of atoms , it is just a supermachine ."
And this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists .
These ripples spread out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral .
It is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony .
Some of the Island is sand and is not suitable for living .
The Island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors ; ;
"This is a fine trip , too , on a good day ."
Even more of an obstacle is the difficulty of separating the influence of Christianity from other factors .
We have already hinted at the fashion in which Christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life .
"In the twentieth century its influence grew , as did that of the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration ."
The ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the Protestantism of the older stock .
The great seal of the United States was obviously inspired by the Christian faith .
O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears .
Some have seen revivalism and the search for Christian perfection as the fountain-head of the American hope .
A number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills .
"Quakers , some from New England , had a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted ."
We cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills .
A few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose .
Several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the century .
"As we have seen , Methodism early took a stand against slavery ."
"Garrison , Massachusetts born of Nova Scotian parentage , was by temperament and conviction a reformer ."
A marked impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the Finney revivals .
As a youth he became one of Finney's band of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men .
They and others employed some of Finney's techniques as they sought to win adherents to the cause .
Individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits ; ;
"they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer , even more terrible abilities ."
Royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power .
"Thus , the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors ."
"The Chinese emperor , by proper observance of ritual , manifested divine powers ."
"He regulated the dualities of light and darkness , Yang and Yin , which are locked in eternal struggle ."
"By swaying the balance between them , he effected the alternation of the seasons ."
"And to offend the dead meant to incur their wrath , and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters ."
The dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear .
"The common belief was that there existed one moral order , which included everything ."
"The Taoists were Quietist mystics , who saw an unchanging unity -- the Tao -- underlying all phenomena ."
"It was this timeless unity that was all-important , and not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality ."
The Taoists believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation ; ;
"After this form of Indian Buddhism had been introduced into China , it underwent extensive changes ."
Confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power .
But let us not be mistaken about Confucian `` virtue '' ; ;
"Propriety was synonymous with ritual observance , the mark of a true gentleman ."
To live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for man's fate .
"This , in brief , was the historical background out of which Zen emerged ."
"Actually , Zen owes more to Chinese Quietism than it does to Mahayana Buddhism ."
One of its features attractive to the West is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred texts .
One patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures for use in an outhouse .
But this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom of action for which the Westerner mistakes it .
The truth -- the Eternal Truth -- is not transmittable by words .
"Reality is considered not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge , but a positive handicap ."
But this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers .
The early Anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed ability to perform miracles .
"There being no bridge , the master had to stop at the shore ; ;"
but his companion crossed the river walking on the water and beckoned to Hwang Pah to follow him .
"The monk then understood the spiritual attainment of Hwang Pah , and praised him as a true Mahayanist ."
"`` Early this morning '' , replied the other , `` I set out from India '' ."
"`` Why '' , said the teacher , `` art thou so late '' ? ?"
"`` I stopped '' , responded the man , `` several times to look at beautiful sceneries '' ."
A closer look at modern Zen reveals many magical carryovers that are still part of popular Zen attitudes .
To the Zen monk the universe is still populated with `` spiritual beings '' who have to be appeased .
Part of the mealtime ritual in the Zendo consists in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings '' .
A Plenary Indulgence under the usual conditions is granted once a month for the daily reading '' .
"Do not wonder that I said to thee , `` You must be born again '' ."
"But as the One who called you is holy , be you also holy in all your behavior ; ;"
"for it is written , You shall be holy , because I am holy ."
"As it is written , There is not one just man ; ;"
The new birth is necessary because the natural man is spiritually dead and blind .
"You also , when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins ."
"And if our gospel also is veiled , it is veiled only to those who are perishing ."
Of his own will he has begotten us by the word of truth .
"We know that we have passed from death to life , because we love the brethren ."
"and this is the victory that overcomes the world , our faith ."
The new birth is necessary because the spiritual kingdom requires a spiritual nature .
"Do not wonder that I said to thee , ' You must be born again ' '' ."
"It is now no longer I that live , but Christ lives in me ."
"You may refuse Him , spit on Him , call Him a devil , curse Him ."
You may take His name upon your lips in oaths and curses if you so choose .
the ever burning lusts of the flesh or the powerful victory of Holy Spirit discipline .
What He does with you then depends on what you do with Him now .
"When you read me , you are holding in your hands the product of many minds and hearts ."
Some of the people who speak through my pages are famous ; ;
Some have walked through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope .
It is the whisper in the heart that urges each one to be better than he is .
It is mankind's wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace .
"Neither had any publishing experience , but they had faith in their idea ."
"Compared to the big , established magazines , my first efforts seemed feeble indeed ."
But from the start they had two important ingredients : sincerity and realism .
Len LeSourd went and lived in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days .
"`` You're not living up to your own principles '' , she told my discouraged people ."
"Visualize them , then , believe you are getting them , and you will have them '' ! !"
They say all personnel have spiritual needs which Guideposts helps to meet .
"Hundreds of civic clubs , business firms and individuals make me available to school teachers throughout the land ."
Three years ago it became possible to finance a Braille edition for blind readers .
Irving Granville and Nelson Rector who travel widely calling on business firms .
"Glenn Kittler has been twice to Africa , once spending a week with Dr. Albert Schweitzer ."
"Sidney Fields , years of experience as a New York columnist ; ;"
There are people who travel long distances to assure my continued existence .
Elaine St. Johns may fly in from the West Coast for the editorial staff meetings .
We have also seen the power of faith at work among us .
"Recently , John Sherrill was stricken with one of the deadliest forms of cancer ."
"We prayed for John , during surgery , we asked others to pray ; ;"
all over the country a massive shield of prayer was thrown around him .
Perhaps it is not fair to mention some people without mentioning all .
"But , you see , those who are not mentioned will not resent it ."
"Perhaps you think the editorial meetings are solemn affairs , a little sanctimonious ? ?"
"There are brain-wracking searches for the right word , the best phrase , the most helpful idea ."
"Each meeting starts with a prayer , offered spontaneously by one member of the group ."
"For you , readers , are an all-important part of the spiritual experiment that is Guideposts ."
"I need your support , your criticism , your encouragement , your prayers ."
yet if you looked closely you'd see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips .
At first I was happy to throw the support of our newspaper behind this man .
"I am sure that Castro was happy , too , about that support ."
None of us was aware that the biggest fight was still ahead .
"Within a week , however , I began to suspect that something was wrong ."
He spent long hours before the TV spitting out promises of revenge .
He showed us how he dealt with his enemies : he executed them before TV cameras .
"In my mind , I began to review : his use of hate to gain support ; ;"
"his division of society into two classes , one the hero , the other the villain ."
But most disturbing of all were the advisers he called to sit with him in the Palace ; ;
"Here was a powerful , ready-made medium , but it could speak only if I told it to ."
It was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had given me .
I knew in that moment that I did not have any choice .

"Far from discouraging Henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments ."
"For in almost less time than it takes to tell it , Henri's bodyweight was increasing rapidly ."
And at once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it .
In his gym the professor has some of the most `` knocked out '' equipment since Vic Tanny .
You need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs .
The dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the Aj .
The `` pull '' exercise in this Super-Set is the one-dumbbell Bent-Arm Pullover .
The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage stretcher ever invented ! !
You'll know when you've made the greatest stretch because your shoulder blades will touch ! !

Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others .
a criterion of muscle `` drama '' that is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike ; ;
The One Leg Lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts .
"Indeed , a lighter weight works much better because a greater , more extensive split can be performed ."
It places terrific tension on the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition .
grasp the bar ( which will rest against the back of your neck ) ; ;
extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split .
"Now raise the weight by straightening your front leg , without moving your feet ."
You should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balance-wise .
The most beautiful bed of pansies I've seen was in a South Dakota yard on a sizzling day .
I sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather .
"He planted the pansy seeds himself , buying them from a pansy specialist ."
Their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains .
"Occasionally , when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did ; ;"
"but pansy seeds , he told me , soon `` run down '' ."
It's best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them .
"I fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the right texture , tilth and body ."
"It isn't easy to describe it , but every gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil ."
"They germinate quickly , the tiny plants appearing in a week , and grow along lustily ."
"they'd rather have things rugged , with only moderate protection on the coldest days ."
If you do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate .
For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting .
"I dig it , rake it smooth , sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray ."
Ants carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby .
Every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller .
The moral is : don't transplant it any oftener than you must .
I put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone meal into each hole with the plant .
"That encourages rooting , and the better developed the roots , the larger and more plentiful the flowers ."
"That keeps in the cold , retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing ."
Don't miss the pansies that appear from time to time through the winter .
"If those aren't enough for you , why not grow some just for winter blooming ? ?"
The pansies I cherished most bloomed for me in February during a particularly cold winter .
I started the seed in a flat in June and set out the little pansies in a cold frame .
"( An unheated greenhouse would have been better , if I had had one ."
"Like strawberries in December , pansies are far more exciting in February than in May ."
"Try pegging down each separate branch to the earth , using a bobby pin to hold it there ."
"Nature's aim , different from ours , is to provide for the coming generation ."
"That done , her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant ."
Here is a word of advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds .
"It is no harder to raise big , healthy , blooming plants than weak , sickly little things ; ;"
But you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow .
"Remove about half the branches from each plant , leaving only the strongest with the largest buds ."
Treat them right and they'll make a showing every month in the year except the frigid ones .
You will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted .
"The flavor is neither sweet , like a pear , nor tart like an orange ; ;"
"Once you become an avocado fan , you will look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation ."
"Today , refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world ."
"The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree , but it is still firm at this point ."
One of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind .
"If the temperature is controlled properly , the avocado will delay its ripening until needed ."
"And unlike other fruits , one cannot eat the skin of the avocado ."
"None of these values is destroyed , not significantly altered by refrigeration storage ."
"Five , four , three , two , one , fire ! !"
The tremendous energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard .
The pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the pit of your stomach .
Never before has the introduction of a weapon caused so much apprehension and fear .
"With a nation defenseless before it , why would the attacker spare the victim's people ? ?"
Wouldn't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete subjugation ? ?
"The will of its people , so crucial in time of peril , would be broken ."
Nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction in hours or days ; ;
and now rockets have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes .
It should be appallingly apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic .
ICBMs have given us a capability which could be used in two different ways .
We must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves .
We must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile .
"Missiles are very valuable weapons , but they also have their too little known limitations ."
"Because of a missile's ballistic trajectory , the location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately ."
Let us suppose the Russians decide to build a rail-mobile ICBM force .
"Why , then , aren't we planning a larger , more important role for manned military aircraft ? ?"
"War , under these circumstances , cannot be one massive exchange of nuclear devastation ."
The forces which survive the initial attack must be found and destroyed .
"But , how does one go about the job of finding and destroying mobile forces ? ?"
"But until we have an effective spacecraft , the answer to the hunter-killer problem is manned aircraft ."
"However , the aircraft which we have today are tied to large , `` soft '' airfields ."
"but the airfield , on which the aircraft is completely dependent , is doomed by the missile ."
"This makes today's aircraft a one-shot , or one mission , weapon ."
This is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft in favor of the missile .
"But remember this -- it isn't the aircraft which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets , it is the airfield ."
Eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic missiles .
There are four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground :
Put aircraft in `` bomb-proof '' hangars when they are on the ground .
Use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their useful life .
"Using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines , develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing ( VTOL ) long-range military aircraft ."
We could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters .
"With powerplants such as these , vertical takeoff and landing combat aircraft could be built ."
"When aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields , they are no longer vulnerable to Aj ."
"Our first necessity , at the very outset of war , is post-attack reconnaissance ."
In a few years we will have SAMOS ( semiautomatic missile observation system ) .
"A ballistic missile cannot , today , tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful ."
SAMOS will be hard put to see through clouds -- and to see in the dark .
Pre-attack reconnaissance is vital but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate the war favorably .
It would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather that post-attack reconnaissance .
It could operate under the clouds and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night .
It is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large yield nuclear weapons .
"But for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems ."
The many and frequent performances of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing .
"Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free rein ."
"And although Schnabel's pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to Schubert's dynamic markings and phrase indications ."
The piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives .
"Turning to the more modern versions , Curzon's ( London ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work ."
The Glazer-Fine Arts edition ( Concert-Disc ) is a model of lucidity and organization .
"( Babin has acquired some of Schnabel's keyboard manner , but his playing is of limited insight ."
"Seen in perspective , many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones ."
Other innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing to acquire in time the status of classics .
Records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music .
"This absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue ."
"A contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained ."
The music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its full sonority ; ;
"All of this would be wasted , of course , if the performance lacked authority and musical distinction ."
For me it has more of both elements than the majority of its competitors .
Too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment .
The Command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration .
"The home listener is overpowered , all right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one ."
The Class had entries from as far west as Wisconsin and as far south as Kentucky .
This year several entries from Canada were entered which made the Junior Class International .
"`` Take away your attitude '' , said Mrs. Long , `` and what have you left ? ?"
Without right attitude the other aids just do not work right '' .
"Mrs. Long wished all the Juniors luck in the Class and stated , `` Have fun ! !"
And may you all continue to show at Westminster in the years to come '' ! !
Mr. Barcus spoke on the subject of scholarships for Juniors -- with which he is very familiar .
He gave a resume of the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship .
`` Junior Showmanship is an extremely worthy project and should be earnestly encouraged '' ! !
"In closing , Mr. Barcus also wished all the Juniors luck in their Class ."
"From there on , each Junior was going to be judged individually ."
"This year Anne Hone Rogers , outstanding Handler , judged the Class ."
A Junior who won two or more wins in the Open Class was eligible .
( The purpose of the Junior Showmanship Competition is to teach and encourage Juniors to become good sportsmen .
She then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship .
"In addition to showing an Irish Setter throughout the year , she also scored with an Afghan ."
Such a Class was tried out successfully at the Westchester KC Show recently .
This Class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given a chance .
"To overcome this unfair judging , the A.K.C. requires that a licensed Handler be present to judge the Class ."
In the morning we leave the room looking as neat as a pin ! !
Are they indifferent to the fact that the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding patient ? ?
Today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport .
Boating has become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea .
"Today , the boat , on its trailer , is brought to the gear and loaded at the door ."
And trailers for boats are not what they started out to be ten years ago .
"You name it , our industry is producing it , and it probably is made in different models ."
There are canoes ideal for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips .
"There are houseboats which are literally homes afloat , accommodating whole families in comfort and convenience ."
"You may have your boat of wood , canvas , plywood , plastic , or metal ."
"You may order utility models , inboard or outboard , with or without toilets , galleys , and bunks ."
You may dress it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose .
American technology in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful interest in American boating .
"These engines can be removed from a boat with relative ease , wherein lies their greatest advantage ."
Great thought has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population of the country ; ;
"Outboard motors , insurance , and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as boats ."
Terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those for home appliances .
"When air travel was in its infancy , the sky was considered big enough and high enough for all ."
What may be acceptable in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line .
"Generally , states reserve for communities the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities ."
Ignorance of the law is no better excuse on the water than it is on land ; ;
lack of ability and common sense can lead to just as much tragedy .
Hand in hand with the legislative program is the industry's self originated and directed safety program .
A primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers .
It is important to note the work of the United States Power Squadrons and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary .
Each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in seamanship piloting and small boat handling .
Boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities may rightfully be called marinas .
The main set of bars are the `` tappets '' and one tappet is connected to each lever .
These can also move a short distance but at right angles to the tappets .
The number of locking bars required depends on how many false moves must be prevented .
Here's how the scheme works : Suppose the operator pulls the lever to clear a particular signal .
The dogs on the other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other tappets .
A signal cannot be cleared until all the related turnouts are properly thrown and locked .
Such locks are nearly always used where the switch points `` face '' oncoming traffic .
"Generally , these locks on turnouts are called `` facing point locks '' ."
The lines connecting the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars .
The blacked-in blades indicate a fixed aspect -- the blade does not move .
"In some low-speed situations , the distant signal is fixed at caution ."
"In other instances where there is no automatic block signaling , the distant has only green and yellow aspects ."
You may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers and locks as you wish .
"Our instructions assume you are building this particular frame , which is for a junction ."
"When cutting the pieces , dress the ends smooth , and square with a smooth file or sanding disk ."
This gives you the spacing for locating the left-hand piece `` B '' .
Compress the assembly when you make the mark to show the location for `` B '' .
Solder this second `` B '' to `` A '' at right angles .
Cap this assembly ( with spacing bars in place ) with a Af bar .
Now cut five Af locking bar spacers ( which run horizontally ) .
Cap the locking bar spacers with two Af directly under the first two `` B '' pieces .
Mark and center-punch all the holes required for screws to hold this assembly together .
"Dress all surfaces with a file , cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs ."
"Now reassemble the frame , using Af roundhead steel screws and nuts ."
Number all the tappet bars before removing them so they can be replaced in the same slots .
Remove all other loose pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth .
Cut off excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut .
Repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet bars .
"A little extra work here will pay off with a smooth , snug-fitting machine when you are finished ."
Each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work progresses to insure snug fitting .
"However , we started with the first row of bars and worked our way back ."
The notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel dog will slide easily over it .
Assemble the parts in the frame and test the sliding action of the mating pieces .
All matching surfaces should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis .
Scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics .
But because science is based on mathematics doesn't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician .
A mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem .
The equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem .
They involve only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic classes .
The symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers placed one above the other .
It is used to separate two or more numbers in a row .
"For use in formulas , fractions should be converted to their decimal equivalents ."
The various mathematical processes can be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places .
Shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of the final result .
It is a number without which the equation cannot be solved correctly .
"When it is needed , one formula is as important as another ."
A rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine .
Most entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions .
Multiplying the result by the number of cylinders in the engine gives the engine's total displacement .
"Dimensions in inches , and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches ."
Dimensions in centimeters and fractions of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters ( cc. ) .
"The formula , with the fractions converted to decimals , becomes Af ."
Cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid .
Cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula : Af .
This is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension .
"However , the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic centimeters ."
The only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms .
The volume of the opening is added to the combustion chamber volume .
This volume is added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening .
The total of these three volumes is the `` final combustion chamber volume '' .
"After the factors just described have been computed , they are applied to the following formula : Af"
Applying these figures to the formula we get the equation : Af .
To simplify the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of the factors .
To determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three factors the formula is : Af .
"Using the same figures as for the previous example , the equation becomes : Af"
"Using the figures from the previous examples , the equation becomes : Af ."
"Fury is upstanding and on the rangy side , and Caper is more the compact type ."
"Then , after emasculation , he was eased up for a couple of weeks ."
He has thrived on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race horse .
"This colt has done everything asked of him , and done it with ease ."
This is one of the best-tempered Tar Heels ever at the center .
The first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare ; ;
But up to date he has shown as much as any in the big Simpson stable .
First Flyer ( Frisco Flyer-Castle Light ) looks like a splendid candidate for the Illinois Stakes .
"The colts in Simpson's stable have little if anything on the fillies , especially the pacers ."
This time she submitted and in a few days was going good .
"She is more like her full brother , Taraday Hanover , but larger ."
Marquis Pick ( Gene Abbe-Direct Grattan ) seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time .
"He is a fine-looking colt with a good body , good set of legs and nice way of going ."
"The last-named is one of the favorites in the stable , and the boys like her very much ."
I will be able to tell you more about this string of equines in the near future .
"In going away Debonnie got behind several lengths , stalling at the start -- she is a little fussy ."
"This filly is another Adios that wants to trot , and trot she did until forced to do otherwise ."
"Rain on Friday prevented many workouts , but there were a few miles of note on Thursday ."
"he's a real hunter and shooter , eager to improve his sport ."
"Well , if you're that kind of sportsman we're here to help you ."
You still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts you'd appreciate most ; ;
"As a Christmas service , I've taken a close look at this year's crop of new models ."
"Read on , take your pick -- and start dropping those hints ."
"For me , a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn't constitute a truly new design ."
Ruger reports that on his recent African safari the little Magnum cartridge was a real work horse .
The deadliness of the Magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to me .
"Three more deer have fallen to this same gun , and all were one-shot kills ."
"If ever a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter , this is it ."
The second really new development this year was a revolver handling a different sort of varmint load -- the
It can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers .
"Aside from the Ruger carbine , a number of hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time ."
Here are the brands ( in alphabetical order ) and the new models .
"Newcomers to the American hunter are the Browning group of bolt-action , high-power rifles ."
They have fine FN actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal and the stock wood .
Shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard on all of the Magnums except the
"It's extremely accurate for an auto , and the test rifle I tried was completely trouble-free in functioning ."
"Once again the Mossberg Targo outfit has appeared , but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun combination ."
You can unscrew this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with
A spring trap for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also available .
This design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard .
"Because of its traditional lines , it probably has more kid appeal than any other model ."
"Stock design is excellent , and this model is a good first gun ."
He had two interests in life : the pleasures of the table and driving .
"The southward route was the classic run in California , and the most fashionable ."
"Gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring , so halts were contrived between meals ."
In the Spanish days Franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense .
It yields a fragrance as Orphic as that of the pastilles of Malabar .
My friend often breakfasted with Vernon on the morning of the regular tallyho run .
"This was an honor , like dining with a captain at his private table ."
The hostler would have the table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove ; ;
then a porter from Manning's Fish House would trot in with a tray on his head .
"Vernon was consummately fond of oysters , and Manning's had been famous for them since the Civil War ."
"Its early morning patrons were coachmen , who fortified themselves for the day with that delicacy ."
"( Gastronomes have long argued about which came first , the Palace's or Antoine's ."
"After the meal , he and his guests went out to inspect the rig ; ;"
"But for the start of the Santa Cruz run , the whip fell ."
"There are many ways of making a kedgeree , every one of which is right ."
"The omelet named for Ernest Arbogast , the Palace's chef , was even more in demand ."
"Sherry remained in his hotel suite , where he amused himself as best he could ."
"Twice he left everything to his entourage , and fled to make the Santa Cruz tour under Vernon's guidance ."
"It was a post of honor , held inviolate for him ; ;"
"Vernon wore a gray tall hat , a gardenia , and maroon Wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly ."
Promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in the tallyho .
"They cantered down the peninsula , not slackening until the coach reached Woodside where the Santa Cruz uplands begin ."
"inns have burned down , moved elsewhere , or taken other names ."
"An agreeable ease suffused Vernon and the passengers of the tallyho , from which there issued clouds of smoke ."
"You arrive there in seersucker , and feel you were half-witted not to bring a mackintosh ."
Vernon kept an account book with a list of all the establishments that he thought worthy of patronage .
"they were struck out with remarks in red ink , denouncing both the cooks and the management ."
He was copious in his praise of those that served food that was good to eat .
"There was Wright's , for one , lost amongst trees , its wide verandas strewn with rockers ."
"It was the haunt of writer Ambrose Bierce , who admired its redwoods ."
"Contribute also an onion , a peeled tomato and two pickled gherkins , and a mashed lime ."
"Vineyards and orchards also grew around Wright's , and deer were rather a nuisance ; ;"
"But no one complained when they wound up , regardless of season , in venison pies ."
"Poach the apples in this syrup for twelve minutes , drain them , and cool ."
"the smoke-filled , art-filled , drama-filled life of the great cities of the East ; ;"
"For this reason , U.S. Camera has prepared this special U.S.A. vacation feature ."
Use this section to plan now to make the most of your vacation in photogenic America .

Some tips for shooting in Northeastern locales : In New York City don't miss coverage of the United Nations .
Pictures can be taken in the public areas and when on tours .
"Around New England , you'll no doubt want a color shot of one of the picturesque lighthouses ."
Be careful here not to overexpose this subject since they are extremely bright and light-reflecting .
Silver Springs features glass-bottom boat rides and in Everglades National Park there are opportunities to photograph rare wildlife .
One of the most delightful spots in a southern tour is the city of New Orleans .
"For restoration of early American life the places to visit are Williamsburg , Jamestown and Yorktown , Virginia ."
"Another Virginia sight and a photographic adventure are the Luray Caverns , lit by photofloodlights ."
In contrast are the vast open stretches of ranch country and oil wells .
The Great Smoky Mountains is another area of the South well worth a visit .
Another scenic spot in Tennessee is Chattanooga where the Rock City Gardens are not to be missed .
"At Charlottesville , Va. , shoot Monticello and the beautiful buildings of the University ."
Best solution is to find an area that is predominantly sunlight or shade .
Try some closeups on Southern blossoms to provide a welcome contrast with the many long-view scenics you'll be making .
For shooting the interiors of the famous ante-bellum Southern mansions make sure your equipment includes a tripod .
"Enough daylight is usually available from the windows , but if you have synchronized flash -- use it ."
Peak action photography is your goal at Miami's Seaquarium and the Cypress Gardens waterskiing events .
A pleasant start to your midwestern vacation is a few days spent in cosmopolitan Chicago .
The farmlands forming the heart of America stretch out across the Midwest from Chicago .
In North Dakota the strangely beautiful Badlands will challenge you to translate its wonder on to film .
"While here , visit Theodore Roosevelt National Park for its spectacular scenery ."
The Black Hills Passion Play is produced every summer and is a pageant worth seeing and shooting .
Similarly in Illinois there is Lincoln country to be seen -- his tomb and other landmarks .
"Itasca State Park , where the Mississippi River begins , is one of the outstanding tourist spots in Minnesota ."
"For a resort area , Mackinack Island , Michigan , is the place to visit ."
Photos of historic dioramas of the area you visit will add depth and background to your vacation photo story .
"Again , be sure your tripod is handy for those sometimes-necessary time exposures ."
"Special events and their dates which will make interesting shooting in the Midwest area , include the following :"
In California is located one of the most popular of the national parks -- Yosemite .
In the Utah area are Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon National Park .
"When that was broken up after the First World War , its name was changed once more ."
Most of the sights lie in the old section across the Golden Horn from the modern hotels .
At the top of the hill the buildings on the left gave way to a park .
On the columns around the immense dome are round plaques with Arabic writing .
"Directly opposite is the emperor's door , through which they entered the building ."
"Across the street on my right I saw the Hippodrome , now a park ."
"Statues and other monuments that stood there were stolen , mostly by the waves of Crusaders ."
"Inside , the walls are covered with blue and white tile , the floor with red and cream carpets ."
"It stands in the middle of what was once the Forum of Constantine , who brought it from Rome ."
"It's a great favorite of the university students , and I joined them there for dessert ."
"Going through a door into another small court , I had the Throne Room directly in front ."
"They are made of gold and covered with emeralds , pearls and other jewels ."
( Do start fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals .
Don't forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting with sauces .
"Make use of the back of the barbecue or of the hood for heating vegetables , sauces and such ."
Sear on both sides then cover meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest results .
"If necessary to replace both halves on grill , sear cuts and allot extra time ."
"For roasts , insert meat thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone ."
Also make sure thermometer does not touch the revolving spit or hit the coals .
"Have a test-run on the family first , to be sure timing and seasoning are right ."
Do buy meat the day or the day before you intend to cook it .
"Limit yourself to good meat and drink , with bread , salad , corn or potatoes as accessories ."
"When you start the outdoor performance , you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen ."
Don't think you have to start with the most expensive equipment in the world .
The simplest grill ( pan type ) or inexpensive hibachi can make you a chef .
There is even one set that has `` barbecue '' written on it .
Or buy half a dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns for different kinds of barbecues .
Except when you prepare `` do it yourself '' shish kebob or a lobster roast .
"In the winter , hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs of the fireplace ."
"Even use your portable electric or gas grill in the winter , inside ."
Get copper or earthenware mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot .
"You need a little stove , a coffee pot and a stew pot ; ;"
You only have to think of franks and sausages to know what I mean .
"Sure , for the most of us , a frankfurter is the favorite ."
"So that his customers should not soil their hands , Feuchtwanger issued white gloves ."
"Years later , franks-in-buns were accepted as the `` first to go '' at the New York Polo Grounds ."
Either way it's hard to beat in flavor as well as ease of preparation .
"To make the picnic frank come close to perfection , remember these tips :"
-- Score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of the way through .
-- Relishes are as vital to the success of the frank as are buns .
"-- Using a portable grill permits you to toast the buns , too ."
You'll have the neighbor's eyes popping as well as their mouths watering ! !
"To prepare mustard cream , blend mustard with enough water to make a thin paste ."
Fold into whipped cream and add a dash of salt and sprinkling of paprika .
"Some tasty frank toppings are chili con carne , Coney Island sauce and savory sauerkraut ."
Coney Island sauce : finely chop several onions and add enough catsup to moisten well ; ;
Savory sauerkraut : add several tablespoons of brown sugar to a can of sauerkraut .
Make a paste of brown sugar and mustard and spread lightly over scored surface .
Knead on lightly floured board and roll out to form a Af-inch rectangle .
"Twist one strip diagonally around each skinless frankfurter , pinching dough at ends to seal it ."
Directions are written for those who have had previous experience in making pottery .
"Instructions for preparing clay , drying , glazing and firing are not given ."
"Glazes , one-stroke ceramic colors , stains , cones as indicated in the individual instructions ."
"Use well-wedged clay , free of air bubbles and pliable enough to bend without cracking ."
The size of wooden mold will determine the amount of clay needed .
"Whenever possible , use the wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay ."
"When mold has more than one design cavity , make individual paper patterns ."
Place the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity design side of wooden mold .
Be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place without locking in air bubbles .
"To release clay from mold , place hands in a cupped position around project ; ;"
"gently lift the edge on far side , then continue to release edge completely around mold ."
"This will prevent the clay from twisting or bending , causing warping when fired ."

Place patterns on rolled clay and cut around them with knife in vertical position .
"Join B to bottom of A , scoring and reinforcing with clay coil ."
Trim excess clay from around lip of mold and set aside while assembling lid .
"To assemble lid , press clay piece C in cavity of wooden design head ."
score other side of D and one side of disk E and join as before .
"While assembled lid is still on design head , gently but firmly press it on plaster board ."

"Make same as salt and pepper shakers , leaving off top pieces ."
Vases may be made into candles by filling with melted wax and a wick .
Put cut pieces on plaster board to dry to firm leather-hard state .
A cardboard pattern cut to fit inside holder will help to prevent warping .
Do not use wood as it will not shrink with the clay and would cause breakage .
Inside of pieces was glazed with three coats of Creek-Turn bottle green antique glaze .
Outside was finished with Creek-Turn brown toner brushed on and sponged off to give antique finish .
Spread article on flat surface to required width before measuring length at center .
"To mark a row or stitch , tie contrasting thread around end of row or stitch to be marked ."
"Most seams are sewn with backstitch , especially on curved , slanted or loose edges ."
"Pin right sides of pieces together , keeping edges even and matching rows or patterns ."
Run end of yarn through several stitches along edge to secure ; ;
Place sleeve seam at center underarm and center of sleeve cap at shoulder seam .
Menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view .
There's a large compartment in the forward cockpit for charts and other items .
The aft cockpit has a Af storage bin over six feet long that doubles as a seat .
"Needless to say , you can't build Hotei in a couple of weeks ."
Start by laying out the six frames and the transom on a level floor .
"Draw each outline in a different-color chalk , one on top of the other ."
In this way you will be able to detect any obvious mistakes .
Nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the plywood planking .
"Be sure all members are parallel , vertical and level as required ."
The joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated Fiberglas cloth and nailed .
It is over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson are spliced .
"The keelson , made of two three-inch widths , is next installed ."
The second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the first .
"Note , however , that it is six inches shorter at the forward end ."
A stem jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to frame one .
Take two three-inch-wide pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make the four .
Then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and bend them into place on the jig .
The second two pieces lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer member .
A number of C clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets .
The battens are carefully fastened in place after some necessary fairing on all frames .
"If you don't own a planer and don't want to buy one , it's well worth renting ."
Another person inside with a weight against each batten will help in the fastening .
The best procedure is to have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off .
I used a Homemaster Routo-Jig made by Porter Cable for this job .
"When cut , the planking is clamped in place for a final and careful trimming ."
The next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at the contact points .
The spray rails are first glued on the outside and fastened from the inside with screws .
Then the chines are rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation .
"Since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails , they are also rough-sanded in that area ."
The cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at a time .
Then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin .
"When the resin has hardened , mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish ."
"I used bright red , mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding the hardener ."
"Using a cheap brush , coat one side of the bottom with the resin and then apply the cloth ."
"When the cloth is smooth , apply another coat of resin , spreading it with a paint roller ."
Be sure it is well saturated and then allow it to harden .
"Before the resin has hardened , screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline ."
"For added strength , I also fastened a small block on each side of every frame and batten joint ."
"Again , these blocks were set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed ."
This is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom .
"When they're on , the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten ."
Note another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between these pieces .
All the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior fir plywood .
"With all deck battens in place , the bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line ."
Bottoms of the floorboards are also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place .
The windshield glass is shatterproof and Plexiglas is used in the cabin .
"For padding the seats and bunks , I used Ensolite , Type Aj ."
"Available in Af sheets , it costs about a dollar a square foot ."
"Most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials , and requires the use of only simple tools ."
Everything possible has been scaled to standard sizes and measurements of materials .
"Wall panels and structural timbers are standard as are windows and doors , making for a minimum of cutting ."
Close to a large city they might even specify the size of the nails used ; ;
Be sure that this information is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion .
"If there are any major restrictions , they usually can be obtained in printed form ."
"Where a building permit is required , find out what you must present when applying for one ."
"In many cases , you must file a complete set of plans with the local building inspector ."
"How are the roads , and how will they stand up ? ?"
A visit in the early spring after a thaw will be very informative .
"Note where the sun rises and sets , and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms come from ."
This will permit you to get a rough estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost .
It is recommended that panels be both glued as well as nailed to the frame .
"The louvers are constructed as shown in the detail , with a drop door for ventilation ."
There are standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels requiring them .
The door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade .
"The filler panels for the gable ends are cut from full Af sheets as shown , leaving no wastage ."
The battens covering the joints are of Af stock and are applied after the walls are erected .
Other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special size lumber for the glass trim .
"In any case , there is no special milling or rabbeting required for the panels ."
wiping with a slightly oiled cloth will discourage rusting of the column and quill .
The rest of the press should be kept clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush .
Be careful to keep the drive belt free of oil and grease .
Belt tension is adjusted by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount .
Keep the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won't slip when pulled by hand ; ;
excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle bearings .
"Turning the housing clockwise will reduce tension , counter-clockwise will increase it ."
Some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide a socket for the chuck key ; ;
"Each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed , depending on the material worked ."
"Generally , the larger the tool and the harder the material , the slower the speed ."
"When drilling all the way through a workpiece , always place a piece of scrap wood underneath ."
"This will not only protect the work table , but also assure a clean breakthrough ."
"In this case , drilling a small pilot hole or clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy ."
The old-time bridges over the Merrimac River in Massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects .
In this sequence I shall write about them in the order of their erection .
"This paper was signed by forty-five persons , subscribing a total of two hundred shares ."
"`` It consists of two divisions , separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore ."
"The division between the island and this shore , consists principally of an arch ; ;"
The whole length of Essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four .
"As Mr. Palmer was educated to house-building only , and had never seen a structure of this nature ; ;"
that he moved with his parents to West Boxford when he was sixteen years old ; ;
"and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect , Moody Spofford ."
"The reporter must have written this with tongue in cheek , because Dexter's oration could hardly be understood ; ;"
"This was built by John Templeman from plans submitted by James Finley of Fayette County , Pennsylvania ."
This chain bridge proved less durable than the wooden arch on the Salisbury end .
He was closely followed by the Ohio and Indiana troops -- thus the old bridge has another distinction ; ;
On the second occasion it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their purpose .
"We have learned a lot -- a dash of hydrochemistry here , a bit about plumbing and pump-priming there ."
We have had sound grounding in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy .
One of us has a pool set in a wooded area very near the house .
The other has his pool far away from the house in a field high on a hill .
Yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the grass is mowed .
"Even a neat , plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold ."
Naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and size of your land .
"And a good several feet around the pool should be neither greensward nor woods , but good hard pavement ."
But not even our first pool-side gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies .
We seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own backyards .
Just short of forty lashes we finally managed to coerce our children to this view .
"Their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool , but on our terms and at our times ."
No friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning beforehand .
"No ringers , either -- even if they are trailing legitimate invitees ."
"No young children may come without adults except for a specific , organized , chaperoned party ."
And accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities .
"A gaggle of gabbling mothers , backs to the pool , is no safeguard ."
We designated one day a week as the time when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours .
"Life-preservers , the buckle-on kapok-filled kind , are held in readiness , too , for the very young ."
"Safety rules , of course , are more important than all the others put together ."
"But fenced or unfenced , no pool-side is the place for running or horseplay ."
"We allow no underwater endurance contests , either , or inexpert versions of water polo ."
They are the result of a constant and careful contest with the elements .
Or you can make pool care the price of swimming for teen-agers .
A brief course in hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future crisis .
A sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool poison green overnight .
You should firmly insist that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water .
Often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense .
"Our experience has taught us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible , from pipes to brushes ."
Draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania .
You can install it yourself -- this is a central system that will cool every part of your house .
"We know , too , that health is never harmed by summer cooling ."
"On the contrary , there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills ."
"The filtered air benefits allergies , asthma , sinus , hay fever ."
Control of temperature and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid .
Heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive heat .
"Clothes hold their shape better , and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words ."
"You'll sleep longer and better , too , awake refreshed and free of hot weather nerves ."
"You can forget about screens , and leave the storm windows up all year around ."
"Best of all , central air conditioning is something you can afford ."
"Manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances , and your savings over starting from scratch will be substantial ."
"If your house is to have a forced warm air system , cooling can be a part of it ."
"If you plan to add cooling later to your heating system , there are things to watch for ."
Be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed .
Be sure your ducts and blower are big enough to handle cooling .
You can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house .
"Instead of radiators you'll have cooling-heating units , each with its own thermostat ."
"The simplest kind of separate system uses a single , self-contained unit ."
One of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating .
"If you are a party thrower , you may need added capacity ."
"You'll need more if the high average is above that , less if it's below ."
A ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice .
Don't urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough .
"An oversize unit will cool off your house quickly , then shut down for a long period ."
Attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately .
"If you have a house which heat doesn't penetrate easily , your unit will have less heat to remove ."
Keep the direct sun from reaching the house and you've won the first battle .
"In a new house , generous roof overhangs are a logical and effective solution ."
"Shade trees , too , are a big help , so keep them if you can ."
"The more directly the sun strikes walls and roof , the greater its heat impact ."
The way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you're going to need .
"You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun , double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation ."
Restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house .
You must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are ; ;
"you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed ."
With such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available .
Begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible .
These are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies .
These are a great aid for planning use back at the office .
Usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions .
Check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests already existing at the site .
One of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or scenery .
A site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic .
An area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf rolling in on a beach .
A site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees and shrubs .
Note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy .
Water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site .
It also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wild life .
A restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use .
a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer .
The route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them .
"The fish , animals , and birds which may be found at the site are another interest ."
Animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas .
"Clams , crabs , and other marine life may add interest at coastal areas ."
Each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done .
Park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in .
-- The size of the area alone can be a determining factor .
An area may be too small for the needs of the project .
Shape of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the development .
The utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site .
"Nearly level areas are required for parking areas , beaches , camp areas , ballfields , etcetera ."
Determine how much topography limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or grading might be .
"-- In addition to its recreation interests , water is needed for drinking , sanitation , and irrigation ."
The quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection .
The area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines .
An area may have been partially logged and requires removal of stumps or clean-up .
"Some shrubs may be of good landscaping value , other areas of brush may need to be cleared ."
"-- How much will wind , rain , sun , and temperature affect the use ? ?"
An area sheltered from strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use .
"Prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor in America was , indeed , brilliant ."
"To the Traditionalists , it was a brilliant satire on modernism ; ;"
"to the Neo-Classicists , it was a challenge to the pre-war world ."
a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times ; ;
Certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon .
"Certainly , America took Prokofieff and his Classical Symphony seriously , and with a good deal of pleasure ."
"We attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites ; ;"
"we studied , taught , and performed his piano sonatas , chamber music , gavottes , and marches ; ;"
we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities .
So young Prokofieff was the darling of success : in his motherland ; ;
"In this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , Prokofieff was recalled to his native land ."
"After this holocaust , a changing world occupied the minds of men ; ;"
"In this changed world , Prokofieff settled to find himself , and to create for large national purpose ."
"Here , Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism -- producing music for the masses ."
It is at this point in his life that the mature Prokofieff emerges .
And with what resource did Prokofieff back up his Credo of words -- with torrents of powerful music .
"Of course , these works are not comparable , even though the same brain conceived them ."
"The early works were conceived for a sophisticated , international audience ; ;"
the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens .
Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per se .
"In orchestration , he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color ."
Need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability .
yet was never caught up in it -- never a slave to its academic dialectics .
So Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them .
But Stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting .
Meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist ; ;
a maladroit reharmonization of our National Anthem ( The Star-Spangled Banner ) ; ;
his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular American commercial songs ! !
"In the process , his native endowments were stretched , strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose ."
Thus in Prokofieff the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics produced one of the great composers of the Twentieth Century .
Mason had to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting .
"On the death of their father , they returned to their home in Batavia , New York ."
"But even on these , the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off ! !"
"Gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique ."
color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition ; ;
"and that over-all , amazing control of large washes which is the Mason stylemark ."
Finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the job is done .
"But for the technical fact , we have the artist's own testimony :"
"`` Of late years , I find that I like best to work out-of-doors ."
"When this linear draft is completed , I dust it down to a faint image ."
Trial and error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles in the final painting .
Then I dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board .
I also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large washes in the studio .
"True , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory ."
"and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky ."
He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; ;
"rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia ."
It is for this reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment .
"His pictures generalize , though they are inspired by a particular locale ; ;"
"they universalize in terms of weather , skies , earth , and people ."
"the Blair Purchase Prize for watercolor , Art Institute of Chicago ; ;"
Our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance .
The Russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics .
"After all , we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics competition ."
"But if it is important , what can we do to improve ourselves ? ?"
"In short , gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great deal of character as well ."
Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life .
( An enterprising teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days .
"First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieves both ."
"Oddly enough , it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty ."
Eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself .
Russia's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous training on apparatus .
They saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing with incredible grace .
"If we wait until children are in junior high or high school , we will never manage it ."
"School teachers , all too unprepared for the job they must do , will need demonstrators ."
They should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught .
Very little in today's living provides the strength we need and nothing provides the flexibility .
"They often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength ."
The only area in which American boys hold their own is the baseball throw .
Those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin-up each time they pass under it .
"When they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent , they will have the strength to chin-up ."
Parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home .
"Arm , shoulder , chest , upper and lower back strength will be aided with the Horse kick ."
"Keeping the hands in the starting position , run in place to a quick rhythm ."
"After this has become easy , use slower and slower rhythms , kicking higher and higher ."
"Push-ups are essential , but few have the strength for them at first ."
Fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest on the floor .
As strength improves start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward .
Try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes from the hands .
The push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide .
"Let the body down slowly , taking at least five seconds for the letting down ."
Five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up .
"Handstands come after arms , chest and shoulders have developed at least a minimum of strength ."
Drop both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back .
Bare feet are better for such work than any form of slipper .
"The child should then bring both legs together overhead , point the toes and tighten the seat muscles ."
Be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor rather than toward the ceiling .
"As flexibility improves , the feet will move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher ."
Later this can be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover .
Improvement can be measured by the lessening distance between toes and head .
"The last essential to the beginner's gymnastic program is the somersault , or forward roll ."
some are actually incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting or standing upright .
"For most small children , learning a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can ."
"He places the hands on either side of the head , keeping the chin down on the chest ."
He then pushes his seat into the air and the teacher guides it over .
"If , however , the child is weak , overweight , or afraid , more help will be needed ."
"then no matter what happens , the child's performance will be controlled ."
It is very important for parents to understand that early training is imperative .
"When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering ."
The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery .
We use the term `` bio-medicine '' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research .
"Recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises , contusions , and simple bursitis ."
This stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside .
These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror ; ;
Instead of the observer's eye the image orthicon in the TV camera does the `` looking '' .
From the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail .
A balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed .
A sonar or radar-type of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for body-tissue evaluation .
A still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself .
This pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made .
"From this doctors can read heart rate , change in diameter , pressure , and effective heart power ."
Applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments .
Bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals .
He can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due to glaucoma .
"The transducer is coupled to the body through a water bath , not shown ."
"Arteries and veins are apparent by their black , blood-filled centers and the surrounding white walls ."
Whatever Hans or Anders learned separately they passed on to each other ; ;
His earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life .
"While Hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother studied law ."
"They supplemented their income by small government assistance , by tutoring and economizing wherever they could ."
He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices .
"However , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in German and Danish periodicals ."
"During Oersted's attendance at the university , it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences ."
The university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level .
"His broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movements opened many doors to him ."
His interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated .
"It is true , that nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication ; ;"
The form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form .
"There , forces are more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism ."
"It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature , as proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb ."
"By that , one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical forces ."
He devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric current .
Esmarch was among those who witnessed Oersted's first demonstration of his discovery .
Electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles .
The resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise .
At this lecture Oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle .
The target chart quickly and briefly tells you which additives do what .
All the additives listed here are sanctioned for use by the Food and Drug Administration of the federal government .
All comments concerning effectiveness and use of drugs have been carefully reviewed by a veterinary medical officer with Aj .
"In some instances , the trade name is shown in parentheses following the chemical name ."

Aids in minimizing the occurrence of feed-lot bloat due to high consumption of concentrates .
Cows receiving drug may not be officially tested under breed registry testing programs .
Greatest benefits have been associated with feeding low-moisture corn in beef-feeding programs .
"For treatment of bloat , drug is fed at a higher level ."
"Also , aids in the control of horn flies by preventing them from hatching in the droppings ."
Aids in reducing the incidence and severity of bloat in beef or dairy cattle on legume pasture .
For the prevention or treatment of acetonemia ( ketosis ) in dairy cows .
Several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk .
All-weather roads must be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year .
"Frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers ."
Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target :
Has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning ? ?
This problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses .
Have you examined this problem of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company ? ?
"Second , in a competitive market , the customer feels his weight and throws it around ."
Too often it is thought of at the last moment of new product introduction .
Have you assessed the importance of service and given it proper attention ? ?
"In spending his money today , the consumer is pulled in many directions ."
Has your company thought through its strategy in this whole `` discretionary buying '' area ? ?
"Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts , there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts ."
"Display merchandising , backed by pre-selling through advertising and promotion , will continue to make strides in the sixties ."
"Salesmanship is still necessary , but it's a different brand of salesmanship ."
Have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products ? ?
Are you experimenting with different selling slants in developing new customers ? ?
No manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out the costs involved .
Computers are being used to keep branch inventories at more workable levels .
`` Selective selling '' -- concentrating sales on the larger accounts -- has been used effectively by some manufacturers .
There may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain .
Do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully -- and with some imagination ? ?
"As a result , distribution costs were cut , customer relations improved ."
"It is accentuated by the need for pre-selling goods , and private label competition ."
How much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program ? ?
Will you be out in the market place with some of these sales-building new products ? ?
"If competition beats you to it , this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store ."
"As markets become larger and marketing more complex , the costs of an error become progressively larger ."
Is your R & D or product development program tuned in to the commercial realities of the market ? ?
"Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register ."
Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization ; ;
"who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume , production , and distribution costs ; ;"
Most marketing people agree it is going to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements .
Have you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future ( both quantitatively and qualitatively ) ? ?
Does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people ? ?
Every single problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning .
Many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis .
We find too many sales and marketing executives so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning .
The key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining your company's marketing problems realistically .
"It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more ."
"This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior designer's training ."
"Obviously , the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated ."
Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum .
It is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise .
The old established independent art schools try their best to fulfill their obligations .
Even the `` history of furniture '' can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern slides .
"Here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced ."
This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students .
In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to the schools .
That is in the continuance of the `` grandfather clauses '' in their membership requirements .
Long hard years of `` on the job '' training had brought them to their competence .
The reason and the day of `` grandfather clauses '' has long since passed .
Beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves .
"Nor will the hack , the Jack-of-all-trades , still found in some of the smaller art schools , suffice ."
Only a few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior design .
This kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer .
"Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable ."
The proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed .
The matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account .
"Most professors in the course must , naturally , again have a higher degree than the course offers ."
One solution is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute .
This brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general .
"In spite of this , many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject ."
"Independent art schools granting degrees must , naturally , follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group ."
How long has it been since you reviewed the objectives of your benefit and service program ? ?
What effort do you make to assess results of your program ? ?
"Are you using the most economical printing methods , paper , etc. ."
"Are there other , cheaper communications techniques that could be substituted ? ?"
Has your attitude toward employee benefits encouraged an excess of free `` government '' work in your plant ? ?
Is your purchasing agent offering too much free-buying service for employees ? ?
Do your employees understand all the benefits to which your insurance entitles them ? ?
Are they encouraged to take full legal advantage of these benefits ? ?
Have you publicized the cents-per-hour value of the company's share of insurance premiums ? ?
When did you last compare your present premium costs with the costs of insurance from other sources ? ?
Do you try to maintain the principle of employee-contributed ( as opposed to fully company-paid ) programs ? ?
Do you protect your holiday privileges with an attendance requirement both before and after the holiday ? ?
Do you plan to limit additional holidays to area and/or industrial patterns ? ?
Are you carefully policing wash-up time and rest periods to be certain that all other time is productive ? ?
Have you considered using vending equipment to replace or reduce the number of cafeteria employees ? ?
Have you checked the cost of subcontracting your cafeteria operation in order to save administrative costs ? ?
Are there possibilities of having cafeteria help work part-time on custodial or other jobs ? ?
Can staggered lunch periods relieve the capacity strain on your feeding facilities ? ?
Would it be feasible to limit the menu in order to reduce feeding costs ? ?
Have you considered gradual withdrawal of subsidies to your in-plant feeding operation ? ?
Are your expenses in this area commensurate with the number of employees who benefit from your program ? ?
Have you audited your program recently to weed out those phases that draw least participation ? ?
Have you considered delegating operational responsibility to your employee association and carefully restricting your plant's financial contribution ? ?
Could an employee's garden club take over partial care of plant grounds ? ?
Would a camera club be useful in taking pictures pertinent to plant safety ? ?
Are you spending too much money on team uniforms that benefit only a few employees ? ?
Are you utilizing vending machine proceeds to help pay for your program ? ?
Do you know the trend in your cost of maintaining access roads and parking lots ? ?
"If you use parking attendants , can they be replaced by automatic parking gates ? ?"
Will your local bus company erect and/or maintain the bus stops at your plant ? ?
"If you provide inter-plant transportation , can this be replaced by available public transportation ? ?"
"If you use company transportation to meet trains or to haul visitors , would taxis be cheaper ? ?"
Do you insist that unneeded salary employees take their vacations during plant shutdowns ? ?
What sort of effort do you make to assure that older or disabled workers are fully productive ? ?
"Would early retirement of non-productive , disabled employees reduce the number of make-work jobs ? ?"
Will your union accept seniority concessions in assigning work for older or disabled employees ? ?
Can your plant nurse be replaced by a trained first-aid man who works full-time on some other assignment ? ?
Do you rigidly distinguish between job- and non-job-connected health problems and avoid treating the latter ? ?
"Are you indiscriminantly offering unnecessary medical services -- flu shots , sun lamp treatments , etc. ? ?"
These factors can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program .
"Above all , don't set up extravagant fringe benefits just to buy employee good will ."
"Unions stress fringe benefits , but the individual hourly worker prefers cash every time ."
"If you want credit for your employee services program , let your workers know what they're entitled to ."
"U. S. Rubber Company , New York , passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits ."
Have the insurance company or your own accounting department break down the cost of your insurance package periodically .
"You may find certain coverage costing much more than is economically feasible , thereby alerting you to desirable revisions ."
It can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates .
"Also , beware of open-end policies , especially in the medical field ."
"Generally , your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that protect him during his working life or during retirement ."
"Thus , you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth cousin's funeral ."
"Also , reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that you'll probably never use it ."
Vending machines can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time .
"Otherwise , you may be saddled with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers ."
And so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age .
Make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements tied into your pension plan .
A non-contributory plan usually won't pay off for the worker until he retires .
"Thus , there is an added incentive to stay on the job ."
Make sure you don't pay for holidays that occur when an employee would not otherwise be working .
It's usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods .
"For example , the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for Washington's birthday ."
Require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay .
"Latest models serve hot meals at reasonable prices , and at a profit to you ."
"If a concessionaire runs the cafeteria , keep an eye out for quality and price ."
"If the soup tastes like dishwater , your employees won't blame the concessionaire ."
Check your cafeteria location to make sure it's convenient for most employees .
Spread your vacation period over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two weeks .
And with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates .
The long and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into a new era .
"As the generations move on , clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports ."
"And millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition , designed for today's hunting and target shooting ."
This program is now nationally known as `` Teen Hunter Clubs '' .
Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the Allied Merchandising Corporation .
"Other pilot programs were conducted by A & S , Babylon , New York ; ;"
The American gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association .
"We trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefited through additional sales of equipment ."
Is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons ? ?
Here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry .
Harassed state park officials often have more campers than they know what to do with .
"The National Parks , always popular camping places , are facing the same pressure ."
There are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the migration to the campgrounds .
"The more people learn about their country , the more they want to learn ."
"But make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy ."
What does the camping couple do to this set of figures ? ?
Long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or four days several times a year .
But it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become .
This is no longer a way of life for the bearded logger and the wandering cowboy .
And this helps explain why so many people are now going camping .
"Neither are shelters , because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper ."
But there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for their individual needs .
"Since the Industrial Revolution , when factories emerged , this classical pattern has been followed ."
This has been more evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased technology .
But the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer .
The old shop adage still holds : `` A good mechanic is usually a bad boss '' .
Yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition of managerial status as the gage of success .
All grades of management seek more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures .
"As several recent books have over-emphasized , we have become the most status-conscious nation in the world ."
He is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and outside ; ;
usually concerned about America's belief that attainment and success are measured in dollars and titles .
"Yet titles are traditionally given only to management men , and income tends to rise with title ."
This difficulty arises even though we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course .
Nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers .
Among the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of General Electric .
"It is common to shift back and forth , working up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions ."
"Also , moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man's recognition as a technical expert ."
"The second level , senior engineer , rates slightly below first-level supervision ."
This reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products -- which are not military .
"A separate research department is , of course , confined to new or future designs ."
We have a few ' consultants ' -- retired engineers retained and called in on certain problems .
"Approximately four years ago , we initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons ."
Scientists who agitate hardest for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept it .
We have discovered that the outward trappings such as private offices and private secretaries are extremely important ; ;
Promotion is too often based on longevity and time in salary grade instead of merit .
`` We have made limited application of the ' parallel ladder ' plan .
"These include encouragement of , and assistance to , the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers ."
Salaries compare favorably with those paid to the first two or three levels of management .
Operations of this nature offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status .
"All scientific staff members will have the title , ' research-staff member ."
It is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result entirely from company efforts .
The idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty .
"As a result of that attitude , others have been discouraged from trying central distribution ."
A new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks the situation at Oakwood Heights .
"Tri-State has acquired its exclusive distribution for the northern , principal heating states ."
There's an advantage in having a firm like Tri-State headed by a lawyer .
"These have to do with property rights , municipal official attitudes and a host of others ."
When a family buys a home the title is subject to a perpetual easement to Tri-State .
He must undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine heating .
"Again , the oil man must read the meters at such intervals as he finds best ."
"The Public Service Commission has ruled that this is not a public utility , subject to their many regulations ."
"Several financial institutions , both banks and insurance companies , have been sounded out ."
"Its figures are a half inch high and very easy to read , even into tenth gallons ."
It will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour .
He believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available .
"It would be pretty difficult to install a Tri-State system in old neighborhoods , and that's an understatement ."
The job of getting property easements and street easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging .
But in a new development where everything starts from scratch the solutions are simple .
"The oilheating industry is looking up , led by a revival of research and development ."
"A primary ingredient in these fields is imagination , and Tri-State Pipeline Corporation deserves a very good mark ."
Every year about this time National Gargle Your Cooling System week rolls around .
It pays in the long ( hot ) run to take good care of the water works .
"Don't save the anti-freeze , even if it the expensive `` permanent '' type ."
"If a lot of rust shows in the drain , use a good flushing cleaner ."
"Of course , you'll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators ."
Be sure the bugs and dirt are blown out of the radiator fins .
Dow says that the fluid can be used now for two years .
Don't let your mechanics pull the thermostats out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours .
"Spring and summer may be here officially , but those thermos stay in ."
"Be careful that you keep adequate coverage , but look for places to save money ."
With many company policies you get a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs .
Usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability plan .
Many of today's developments in thermoforming stem from original work done with signs and displays ; ;
the art of preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers ; ;
There is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below .
"Four years ago , the company's entire line was devoted to neon signs ; ;"
"From the volume standpoint , the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive ."
What accounts for the rapid growth of plastics in the sign and display field ? ?
The lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings are needed .
"Finally , maintenance costs on plastic signs are much lower than on fragile neon signs ."
Vacuum- and pressure-formed sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded plastics .
"Internal illumination , protected from the elements , gives them powerful visual appeal at night ; ;"
Among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field are expandable styrene molding and blow molding .
"Often , the finished sign or display incorporates several types of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques ."
Spare sets of face panels simplify the change from one copy or message to another ; ;
new panels are exchanged for the old right in the field on a single trip .
Panels with outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied .
Thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent plastics faces ; ;
"In this way , the sign maker has an economical means for displaying uniform copy on different sign media ."
Recently Industrial Electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern plastic materials -- a revolving spectacular sign .
"Signs are meant to convey a message , and in most cases , this requires words and letters ."
"Frequently , the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products , price changes , etc. ."
"For large letters , e.g. thermoformed of acrylic or butyrate , there are other techniques ."
"The sheets are extruded of Tenite butyrate by Jet Specialties Co. , Los Angeles , Calif. ."
Don't build from the outside in -- try to build from the inside out
"Don't insert your components into fixed openings , they may or may not fit ; ;"
Don't wall in your kitchen before you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances .
Set your bathtub before you close in the end of the bathroom .
Finish installing and connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them in .
There is no better way to waste time than trying to install a furnace in a finished Af closet .
Don't position your studs before you insert your windows in conventional construction ; ;
that way you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the window .
Last wall Bob Schmitt erects is the wall between the house and garage .
That way he can truck his parts right indoors and unload them under the roof .
"It changes the answers to `` Who should do what , and where '' ? ?"
It changes the answers on when to do what at the site .
The revolution now under way in materials handling makes this much easier .
"The revolution is well under way , but much more remains to be done"
Five years ago a House & Home Round Table cosponsored by the Lumber Dealers' Research Council reported unhappily :
`` Only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads ; ;
only one box car in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads ; ;
only one producer in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads ; ;
only one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads .
Before that we lumber dealers were working almost single-handed on the problem '' .
Truck and materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to meet almost every homebuilding need .
So manufacturers have pioneered a new type of vehicle -- the self-unloading carrier .
"Restudy what your men do , to help them waste less of the time you pay for"
"This is the most penny-wise , pound-foolish chisel a builder can commit ."
There comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to be alone .
"Not necessarily to be off all by ourselves , but away from the crowds and common happenstance ."
They've been there since the days of the Moors and the Saracens .
The answer to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one .
"You can wait , of course , until you arrive in Europe before renting your car ."
International Touring Documents are usually provided with the car as are road maps and touring data .
"A valid American driving license is accepted in all countries except Portugal , Spain , Yugoslavia and Eastern Europe ."
"Rental fees are variable , too , throughout the countries of Europe ."
There are as many rates as there are countries and models of cars available .
Your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed by the number of people travelling in your group .
"Quite naturally , there is a greater availability of those models which are manufactured within a specific country ."
There are reasons for some people not wanting to rent cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan .
"At this point , unfortunately , romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture ; ;"
To her peanuts and emeralds would have been just so much blubber .
The point -- quite simply -- is this : words they might have had ; ;
"The symbols of mother's status , here , are all usual for culture U.S.A. ."
An accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp .
Newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level .
Linguistic charting of the transcribed interview flags points where the patient's voice departs from expected norms .
"or surprise , which would set the patient apart from other people ."
"The patient , on the other hand , is far from neutral ; ;"
He may then very well conclude that `` everybody '' is probably not the true target of her resentment .
The linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence ; ;
to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen .
What he does do is give himself away by communicating information over and above the words involved .
"Stammering or repetition of I , you , he , she , et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty ."
The word that is not used can be as important as the word that is used ; ;
"She was just another freighter from the States , and she seemed as commonplace as her name ."
Some extremists went so far as to urge our using it first .
`` Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind .
"This country has not used them , and I hope that we never will be compelled to use them ."
So the vile cargo went into the hole of the John Harvey .
Only a few other people -- very important people -- knew of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks .
Capt. A. B. Jenks of the Office of Harbor Defense was very worried .
He knew that German long-range bombers had been returning to the attack in Italy .
"After it had reappeared the next two nights , Jenks went to higher headquarters and said :"
`` For three days now a German reconnaissance plane has been over the city taking pictures .
They're just waiting for the proper time to come over here and dump this place into the Adriatic '' .
But the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist .
"True , there had been raids on Naples -- but Naples was pretty far north on the opposite coast ."
"More than that , Allied air had complete superiority in the Eighth Army's sector ."
The Royal Air Force had but a single light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available .
And everywhere in evidence among the few remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster -- multiple command .
Then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a radar-controlled shore gun firing white tracers .
"`` This harbor is a bomber's paradise '' , the Britisher had said with frank grimness ."
"We can't expect any help from the fighters at Foggia , either ."
He thought of the tons and tons of flammable fluid beneath his feet and shook his head .
What would his guns guide on then -- the North Star ? ?
"For five days now , they had been in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold ."
"He hoped they would put in somewhere way , way down in the earth ."
Deck Cadet James L. Cahill and Seaman Walter Brooks had been the first to leave .
Richardson had returned their departing grins with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer's stock in trade .
"The other half of the crew , plus Beckstrom and his men , had remained aboard ."
Damned if that wasn't a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor -- Porto Vecchio .
The night was so clear that Richardson had no difficulty making out the silhouette .
"Then the thought of a cloudless sky made him shiver , and he glanced upward ."
It was the silver foil from the chocolate bar he had been eating .
"They had ruined the radar warning system with their window , they had made themselves invisible above their flares ."
Captain Musmanno roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for a raft .
They got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few minutes before their schooner went under .
"Ensign Vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly , but they had no targets ."
"Luckily , she was not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt ."
"You explain , `` I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before ."
Occasionally there are examples of pre-vision which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude .
The famous author tells us of the strange incident in Something About Myself .
"Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision ."
"In most cases we recognize certain words , persons , animals or objects ."
"whereas , it is a matter of fact that Smith cannot drive a car ."
The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support .
But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? ?
Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists of minute waves of energy .
This theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness .
Consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions .
Dr. Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream .
No doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the sleeper's mind .
Probably less than one percent of our previsions escape final obliteration before we wake .
But the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene .
"He remembered exactly when he had lived through it before , and he had something to prove he had ."
`` The food is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to be here '' ! !
From fourteen states and three foreign countries they come to spend the months from mid-September to June .
The school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school .
Throughout the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat .
"After reading `` Plowman's Folly '' by Edward H. Faulkner , he stopped plowing ."
Separate pails were kept in the kitchen for coffee grounds and egg shells .
It was applied with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader .
New ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil treatment .
"`` After the soil , the kitchen '' , says Mr. Clark ."
The first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread .
`` Adults take a long time to convince and you are thwarted if you try to push '' .
"At first the kitchen help was tolerant , but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves ."
"`` You can't make French toast with whole-wheat bread '' , was an early complaint ."
"Mrs. Clark , as house manager , planned the menus and cared for the ordering ."
Today whole grains are freshly ground every day and baked into bread .
Surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in the state .
"Miss Colman pours measures of whole wheat , oats , and soy beans and turns on the motor ."
She goes on about her work and listens for the completion of the grinding .
The bread baked from this mixture is light in color and fragrant in aroma .
"Occasionally , the children find steamed , whole-wheat grains for cereal which they call `` buckshot '' ."
"The school has received letters from parents asking , `` What happened to Johnny ? ?"
"He never used to like any hot cereal , now that's the only kind he wants ."
Where can we get this cereal he likes so much '' ? ?
Sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads and dishes such as chop suey .
"The school raises enough poultry , pigs , and beef cattle for most of their needs ."
Hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility .
"Organ meats such as beef and chicken liver , tongue and heart are planned once a week ."
"Also , salt water fish is on the table once a week ."
"For deserts , puddings and pies are each served once a week ."
Dried fruits are purchased from sources where they are neither sulphured nor sprayed .
Apples come from a farm in Vermont where they are not sprayed .
Oranges and grapefruit are shipped from Florida weekly from an organic farm .
Miss Colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available at the tables .
Raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table for the children to help themselves .
Very few fried foods are used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged .
The source is known so there is no necessity to remove insecticide residues .
"On their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains , the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail ."
Maple syrup is made by the children in the woods on the school grounds .
This and raw sugar replace ordinary refined sugar on the tables and very little sugar is used in cooking .
"Homemade of meat , bones and vegetables , it is rich in dissolved minerals and vitamins ."
The cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a day .
Rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and a half every day in all kinds of weather was the rule .
"A vigorous program existed in skiing , skating sports and overnight hiking ."
Visitors to the school ask what shampoo they use on the children's hair to bring out the sheen .
"Buffeted by swirling winds , the little green biplane struggled northward between the mountains beyond Northfield Gulf ."
He peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again below .
The girders of a shattered Dog River bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream .
"The nearest undisrupted end of track from Boston was at Concord , N. H. ."
"Over in Barre the streets had been deep in swirling water , and bridges were crumpled and gone ."
The `` Barre Aviation Field '' was set to receive its first aircraft the Sunday following the flood .
"They had to act fast , for letters were clogging the terminals ."
"Tall , wiry , dark-haired Bob Fogg had already racked up one historical first in air mail history ."
"In Concord , Bob Fogg was the most prominent New Hampshire boy with wings ."
"`` But Fogg '' , they countered , `` we can't get over there ."
With the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply flown into the hillside .
"As a wind direction indicator , they tied a cotton rag to a sapling ."
`` Ceilings '' were judged by comparison with known mountain heights and cloud positions .
( He'd get the engine oil flowing with an electric heater under a big canvas cover .
Concord learned to set its clocks by the rackety bark of the Whirlwind's exhaust overhead .
"Sometimes , on a return trip , the aviator would `` go upstairs '' high over the clouds ."
Bob Fogg didn't have today's advantages of Instrument Flight and Ground Control Approach systems .
"At a nod of his head they let go , turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream ."
Tracks in the snow showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred feet .
"One afternoon during a cold , powdery snowstorm , Fogg took off for Concord from the St. John field ."
"If so , are you saying , `` Where did the last few years go ? ?"
"Also you can spell , without consulting a dictionary for every other word ."
It is the way you were taught and your way of life .
All this is standard equipment for a man of your day ; ;
"However , the last few years of your life , things seem to be changing ."
"Now , looming on the horizon are such things as estimated totals , calculated risks and I.B.M. machines ."
"When a plan burst its seams , hasty conferences supply the necessary patch , and life goes merrily on ."
Some are blest with an abundance of good health -- some are in poor health and many are invalids .
Some have beautiful gardens -- some not even a blade of grass .
The question is `` How are you going to live with it '' ? ?
"But , if you do , your life will be just one thing -- unhappiness -- complete and unabridged ."
Make up your mind to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years of life .
"One thing , I am sure of , you must get an interest in life ."
"Many of you will say , `` Well , what can I do '' ? ?"
Find out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl .
"If you can't think of a thing to do , try something -- anything ."
"Maybe you are not that gifted either , but how about puttering around with the old paints ? ?"
"Does making your own clothes or even doll clothes , interest you ? ?"
"Do you love to run up a hem , sew on buttons , make neat buttonholes ? ?"
"Then again , there's always that lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs ."
"How's about mosaic tile , ceramics or similar arts and crafts ? ?"
"Do you yearn to make cakes and pies , or special cookies and candies ? ?"
Some people can carve most anything out of a piece of wood .
"Some make beautiful chairs , cabinets , chests , doll houses , etc. ."
"Ever since I was a child , I have always had a yen to try my hand at writing ."
"If you do decide to write , you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips and dejection ."
"Few new writers have their first story accepted , so they tell me ."
"But , it could happen , and it may happen to you ."
"You say , `` But it costs a lot of money to have a hobby ."
It does cost a lot of money for most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free .
"Also , there's scrap books , collecting newspaper pictures and clippings , or any items of interest to you ."
I just don't have time to do half the things I want to do now .
"What does it mean to be creative , a term we hear with increasing frequency these days ? ?"
When we turn to Noah Webster we find him helpful as usual .
"We are creative , it seems , when we produce something which has not previously existed ."
Man's great superiority over these evolutionary forbears is in the development of his imagination .
In our own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a Jules Verne come into actuality .
We know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles .
"Some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote , Victorian past ; ;"
First intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen .
"Ignorance on this point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety , misunderstanding and suspicion ."
"( Hymen , in fact , is the Greek word for membrane ."
But there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations of the folk-lore beliefs .
"More rarely , the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration ."
"Obviously , the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new situation ."
Gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage .
The intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control .
But an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman .
The advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological .
"Since it is a purely professional situation , none of the pain is associated with love-making or the beloved ."
In this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl .
She learns how to relax them to accept -- instead of contracting them to repel -- the entering object .
Special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value .
"The long , unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels ."
and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times .
These regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse .
The husband and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in mind .
"Ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride , both physically and psychologically ."
Serious attention must also be given to the husband's problems in the honeymoon situation .
The necessity for keeping alert to his bride's hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous desire .
The emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax .
This is a very common experience and should in no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife .
The signals to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to take advantage of them .
The best course is to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again .
This may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered .
Too many new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment .
Only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse .
It is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves '' .
The wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrated in the Kinsey studies in human sexuality .
Attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions .
One is always a little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected .
"In tradition and in poetry , the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony ."
"At its most ecstatic moments , husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares ."
But marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved .
"In the past , it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive ."
"The whole act is tailored to her pleasure , and not to theirs ."
"Beyond a certain point , of course , no woman can be dominant -- nature has seen to that ."
But there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed .
"Of course , there remain many `` old-fashioned '' marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy ."
"Yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are asserting themselves more strongly ."
"The meekest , most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother's or grandmother's standards ."
"Our society has `` emancipated '' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority ."
It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role .
`` It reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself .
"And she begins to regard him as savage , bestial and unworthy ."
More typical is the case of a suburban Long Island housewife described by a marriage counselor .
This woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired '' for marital relations .
"To please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores ."
"After every money argument , she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor ."
Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed .
She knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband .
"Unless her husband also desires sex , the act cannot be consummated ."
"Generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his wife's mercy ."
There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom .
"Furthermore , Dr. Calderone says , a certain number of docile , retiring men always have been around ."
"Asked why , he replied primly : `` Because that's no activity for a gentleman '' ."
"and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything , including the marriage bed ."
"Circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child-rearing , money-handling and home maintenance ."
She found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless .
A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well '' .
Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax .
"Not surprisingly , Dr. Ellis says , some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities ."
"An aggressive woman wants a man to demand , not knuckle under ."
"If his on-the-job problems work out , he may return to his old pattern ."
`` The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment '' .
"He must become more expressive of his own desires , more demanding and less ' understanding ' '' ."
"The New York D.A. gave her another , The Golden Girl of cafe society ."
"Houston police gave her a third , less flamboyant , title , prostitute ."
It was when she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation she liked best .
`` At Deauville she met an Egyptian by the name of Pulley Bey .
"He was the official procurer for King Farouk , now in exile ."
`` We have checked her in different parts of Europe and Egypt and finally back into this country .
`` Our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts to Jelke '' .
"I am not a prostitute , and I had only one very wealthy boy friend '' , she said ."
"During the course of the trial , Jelke backed up part of that statement ."
But she seemed to have underestimated the number of her `` boy friends '' .
"She was Mary Lou Brew then , wide-eyed , but not naive ."
She had talked her `` boy friend '' into sending her to New York to take a screen test .
"An ex-fighter was introduced to her in a bar as `` Mr. Warfield , the famous producer '' ."
The phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows .
"After a few minutes he said , `` I can't use you if you dance like that ."
"Diane loved to dance in the nude , something she was to demonstrate time and again ."
"She wanted to go around the world , but she settled for a French holiday ."
In an anonymous interview with a French newspaper the financier told of spending several months with her .
`` Then she went to Deauville where she met a member of a powerful Greek syndicate of gamblers '' .
And in short order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way .
It was a rugged finish for what must have been a very interesting night .
`` The actor had had much to drink and apparently became very violent .
In the morning she found rooms directly across from the Excelsior at the equally luxurious Hotel Ambassador .
"With the Ambassador as headquarters , she continued to promote good will abroad ."
A close friend of hers in the Roman days described it this way :
She had a hard time making him understand that it was Farouk she wished to meet .
"`` Pulley Bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him '' , the friend continued ."
She picked her own Middle-Eastern friends from the flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her .
"Tewfik Badrawi , Mohammed Gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of Cairo society enjoyed her company ."
"When Farouk was overthrown , police picked up his personal pimp , Pulley Bey ."
They also called upon Diane with a request for a look at her passport .
"Officials provided a temporary passport , good only for return to the United States ."
Newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated that she was co-operating with the District Attorney .
It was no longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous `` Lady Harrington '' .
"Several years ago she married a Houston business man , Robert Graham ."
"She later divorced Graham , who is believed to have moved to Bolivia ."
"She had had a party with a regular visitor , Dr. William W. McClellan ."
He had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had happened during that time .
"When he realized she was dead , he called two lawyers and then the police ."
"When the police arrived , they found McClellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently ."
"The blonde's nude body was in bed , a green sheet and a pink blanket covered her ."
"Police theorize that a combination of dope , drink and drugs killed her ."
"`` I think that maybe she wanted it this way '' , a vice squad cop said ."
"She was on the junk , and they slide fast when that happens ."
I work for one of the biggest chains of retail carpet houses in the East .
I am selling the stuff of which is made one of the Great American Dreams -- wall-to-wall carpeting .
They depend on my supposedly expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little .
`` Doctor '' Lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes .
"She had -- he informed her -- kidney trouble , liver trouble , and a severe female disorder ."
"Yes , the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything , he assured her ."
"Did she know , he asked , why the colors of the tubes were important to people's health ? ?"
"For that reason , he informed her , the Lord made the sky blue ."
But as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about .
Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs. Shaefer to buy his machine when she visited him the next day .
"When she submitted to his treatment with the capsules , Mrs. Shaefer felt intense pain ."
"Leaving Lee's office , Mrs. Shaefer hurried over to her family physician , who treated her for burned tissue ."
"For several days , she was ill as a result of Lee's treatment ."
His plunder is therefore far higher -- running into hundreds of millions .
Authorities believe that many of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business .
Look at the sums paid by two device quack victims in Cleveland .
Multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually .
"In this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative ."
"The economic toll that the device quack extracts is important , of course ."
Sarah Gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not helping her .
"Mr. A has recovered , but he is , justifiably , a bitter man ."
"`` That's a lot of hard-earned money to lose '' , he says today ."
`` Neither me nor my wife were helped by that chiropractor's treatments '' .
But he's a welfare case now -- a human wreck -- thanks to this modern witch doctor .
His prescription : hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water .
Ten-year-old Richard Stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome for almost a year .
"His grades had gone steadily downhill , and he had stopped bringing friends and classmates home from school ."
occlusion is the dentist's expression for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed .
"Malocclusion , or a bad fit , is what parents need to look out for ."
One main type of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper front teeth .
A child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions :
"Second teeth that have come in before the first ones have fallen out , making a double row ."
Occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect a youngster's teeth ; ;
"but after that , if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent , it will have an effect ."
Malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long .
"Some such youngsters rarely smile , or they try to speak with the mouth closed ."
"Yet from the dentist's point of view , bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons ."
"Because of these chewing troubles , a child may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition ."
Badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping .
This appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on the bone .
"This must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue grows , and no faster ."
Parents are often concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay .
"When in place , a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth that is covered ."
During these visits the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth .
Usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and stretching across the teeth .
Susie may wear this only at night or for a few hours during the day .
Straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may take only a few months .
An added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three years to correct .
The charge for a complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country .
"`` Costs may seem high , but they used to be even higher '' , says Dr. Brodie ."
In many cities in the United States clinics associated with dental schools will take patients at a nominal fee .
Some municipal agencies will pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents .
"now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large extent '' , he says ."
"For example , a boy may inherit a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another ."
"The child is kept on call , and the orthodontist watches the growth ."
"`` Nature often takes care of the problem '' , says Dr. Brodie ."
`` A child with a certain type of head and teeth will outgrow tooth deformity '' .
"Let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start treatment '' , he urges ."
"Plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used , and they save time and money ."
`` Then see that your youngster has a routine checkup once a year '' .
"To help prevent orthodontic problems from arising , your dentist can do these things :"
In turn the other teeth are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them .
"Some mediums speak in practical , down-to-earth terms , while others may stress the spiritual ."
"However that may be , people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons ."
What we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation .
He himself might not have been really aware of his own mood ; ;
"In this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator , nothing else ."
Now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him .
One sitter may think `` a leather couch '' identifies a reading as surely directed to him ; ;
After being a lawyer for twenty-five years he started studying for the ministry .
Part of his house had been moved to the other side of the road .
Methods have been developed of assigning `` weights '' to statements ; ;
that in the United States more people die of heart disease than of smallpox .
So each reading can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these weights .
He is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his .
"Does she often speak of locations , of cause of death ? ?"
"Does she accurately give dates , ages , kind of occupation ? ?"
Mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses .
"The sensitive often seems to smell definite odors , too , or subjectively feels emotions ."
"Simply using it increases its intensity , I was told by one sensitive ."
Impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value .
taken with other details it could have referred to a state of mental or spiritual confinement .
In this connection it is worth noting how names are sometimes obtained .
The farmer's life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock .
A slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens .
He cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice ; ;
"The farmer must get up early , and , at times , work late at night ."
Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain .
"Drought , hail , disease , and insects take their toll of crops ."
"Sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner's earnings , even into his capital ."
Returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year .
Part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities .
It will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment .
There will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his off-farm job .
The farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lost .
"For some retired persons , part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income ."
It is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health .
"Generally , the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city ."
"The savings are not as great , however , as is sometime supposed ."
A part-time farmer and his family can use their spare time profitably .
"For some white-collar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job , and a physical conditioner ."
"Part-time farming can take comparatively little land , labor , and equipment -- or a great deal ."
It depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation .
"General requirements for land , labor , and equipment are discussed below ."
"You could not , of course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small ."
But consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work .
The cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision .
Some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development .
Sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract .
List the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month .
You may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one .
"If you are going to produce for home use only , you will need only hand tools ."
"You will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing , however ."
"For larger plantings , you'll need some kind of power for plowing , harrowing , disking , and cultivating ."
Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer .
Discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm .
Choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities .
Then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell the farm .
The presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable .
There are slums in the country as well as in the city .
"If these facilities are not at the door , getting them may cost more than you expect ."
You may have to provide them yourself or get along without them .
The following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses .
Is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise ? ?
"If you can't tell , get help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist ."
"Soil type , drainage , or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones ."
Will the house on any part-time farm you are considering make a satisfactory full-time residence ? ?
How much will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating ? ?
"To do this , set up a plan on paper for operating the farm ."
List the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expected to produce in an average year .
"To find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming ."
Include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings and equipment .
Also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family .
"It may be hard to decide what this labor is worth , but charge something for it ."
"Otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor ."
"in the United States the initiation of militant anti-Communism , with the repentant ex-Communist in the vanguard ."
"The Eichmann case looked to the past , not to the future ."
"As such , it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a `` message '' ."
"The measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government ."
whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually .
"clinging to the enemy-Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; ;"
Wasn't this meaning of Eichmann's experience in various countries worth highlighting ? ?
It is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable ; ;
"Family planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring ."
These are substantially the same factors considered by Non-Catholics in family planning .
The laws of many states permit birth control only for medical reasons .
There is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement .
Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past .
That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today .
"Today , the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction ."
the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control '' .
The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives .
The board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning .
It called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives .
This viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country .
Repeated polls have disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth control .
Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : The civil law is concerned with public crimes .
Among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived imposition would be religion itself .
"When she reached port , she was found to have on board only eight men , all near starvation ."
The man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman .
These questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time .
Historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations .
"Twice he had failed , and the Muscovy Company indicated it would not back him again ."
"This time he turned westward , to the middle Atlantic coast of North America ."
He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth .
"One by one , the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded ."
"In fact , Hudson's sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes ."
"But there remained one mysterious , unexplored gap , far to the north ."
"He named this opening , between Baffin Island and Labrador , the `` Furious Overfall '' ."
Hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway .
"Worse , his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before ."
"Of only one could he be sure -- young John Hudson , his second son ."
"Philip Staffe , the ship's carpenter , was a good worker , but perversely independent ."
Hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer .
Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the Thames .
"There at the river's edge waited one Henry Greene , whom Hudson listed as a `` clerk '' ."
Poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called `` Lousie Bay '' .
"With Hudson looking on , his protege Greene picked a fight with the ship's surgeon , Edward Wilson ."
"With difficulty , Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship , and they sailed from Iceland ."
The ship's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic North Pole .
For weeks he had been saying that Hudson's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd .
"The great , crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason ."
A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would sail no farther .
"Patiently , he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives ."
"When Hudson had finished , the `` town meeting '' broke down into a general , wordy argument ."
"Up spoke carpenter Staffe , who said he wouldn't give ten pounds to be home ."
"Hudson named the capes Digges and Wolstenholme , for two of his backers ."
"After three weeks' swift sailing , however , the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas ."
The great `` sea to the westwards '' was a dead end .
"This was the bitter end , and Hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure ."
"The men were at first puzzled , then angered by the aimless tacking ."
"Hudson , presiding , heard Juet's defense , then called for testimony from crew members ."
There were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves .
"As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little bay , every incident lessened the crew's respect for him ."
"Just as it was being hauled inboard , a sea hit the ship ."
Michael Butt and Adame Moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured .
Here they built huts and a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland .
The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by British fur traders .
They were held together by pegs and withes and in later times drawn by a single ox in thills .
It was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on Mackinac boats .
Thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round .
It was from the American outposts that Red River shortages of livestock were to be made good .
"Observing their distressing condition , Colonel Snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation ."
For its part the Hudson's Bay Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement .
In April came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-June .
"Below the fort , high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi River ."
A third wrote that it was `` raining like poring peas on a rawhide '' .
A Texan wrote to a male companion at home : `` what has become of Halda and Laura ? ?
"if they should bite before I wake , I pray the Lord their jaws to break '' ."
But he was very much like his associates in his hatred of camp routine .
The soldiers who comprised the rank and file of the Civil War armies were an earthy people .
They talked and wrote much about the elemental functions of the body .
Men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this condition as `` looseness of the bowels '' ; ;
`` I expect to be tough as a knott as soon as I get over the Georgia Shitts '' .
It sowered ( on ) my stomack and turn loose on me '' .
The letters which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances .
"In the South , after the first year of the war , paper and ink were very poor ."
"I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes , but we take no notice of them now '' ."
Just count each blot a dodge and add in a few for I don't dodge every time '' .
the most common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives .
"and these , full of homely advice , are among the most human and revealing of Civil War letters ."
Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro community .
Initiation into combat sometimes elicited from soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions .
A Federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his first skirmish in Virginia : `` dear Pa .
Thay may say what they please but godamit Pa it is fun '' .
Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers .
A Floridian stated that his officers were `` not fit to tote guts to a bear '' .
"His head cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment , much less a corps ."
Jackson runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow their leader .
But he is a West Point graduate and therefore must be born to command '' .
Similar comments about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers .
No group of officers came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors .
A Pennsylvania soldier wrote that `` they were the hardest looking set of men that ever I saw .
They looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings .
They recooned as how you'uns all would be a heap wus to we'uns all ' '' .
The popularity of folklore in America stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in America .
And the emphasis on nationalism in America is in proportion to the growth of American influence across the world .
Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence .
What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred .
"Yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man in the street ."
"Anyone's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement ."
Such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes .
Parson Weems's George Washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of the uniting States .
"Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve , vary and recreate through oral transmission ."
"After all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates ."
"Folklore is his hobby , and he , all too rightly , wishes it to remain as such ."
he hunts folklore for the very `` field and stream '' reasons that many persons hunt game ; ;
and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located .
Both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found .
Both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage system and the electric light lines .
"His standards are , of course , completely foreign to those of the analyst ."
"As a result , most people don't have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is ; ;"
Is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an America that was ? ?
When he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged .
The folk are simply not homogeneous with respect to nation or political attitude .
The police credited him with twenty-five murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them .
"He was an expert florist , tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths ."
He had what was described by a psychologist as a `` sunny brutality '' .
The reception was held in a private dining room of the Webster Hotel on Lincoln Park West .
"It was an interesting fraternisation of ex-convicts , union racketeers , ward heelers , sold-out officials , and gunmen ."
The guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of American civic life at this time .
It included the top O'Banion men and Chief of Detectives Michael Hughes .
Then O'Banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds .
This further demonstration of O'Banion's ballooning power did not please Torrio and Capone .
In the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking .
"O'Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave , severely wounding him in the stomach ."
"A second bullet ricocheted off Max's belt buckle , leaving him unhurt but in some distress ."
O'Banion tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre ; ;
"Why , I can get them knocked off for half that much '' ."
But Torrio and Capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman .
"They had suffered , in sulky silence , the sight of his sharp practice in Cicero ."
once again O'Banion's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill will .
"A tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide , an earthquake or a volcanic eruption ."
its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the English coast .
The dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement .
"The greater the depth of the water , the greater is the speed of the wave ; ;"
Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable .
Their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest .
The giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones .
This is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the first great trough arrives .
"Reefs are left high and dry , and the beaches are covered with stranded fish ."
At Hilo large numbers of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach .
"Just as they reached the shore , the first huge wave crashed upon them ."
Usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest .
"Their onrush and retreat , he reported , was accompanied by a great hissing , roaring and rattling ."
On some of the islands' beaches the waves came in gently ; ;
they were steepest on the shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come .
"the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom-living diatoms , raised to the surface by the disturbance ."
"Such equipment has been installed at Hilo , Midway , Attu and Dutch Harbor ."
There is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage .
"But it is plain that a warning system , however efficient , is not enough ."
Life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man .
"The land , too , is changing , and earthquakes are daily reminders of this ."
Earthquakes result when movements in the earth twist rocks until they break .
Sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground surface ; ;
"often the shifts cannot be seen , but they are there ; ;"
and everywhere can be found scars of earlier breaks once deeply buried .
"The effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized , even overemphasized ."
Knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been applied in various fields .
The following discussion of this subject has been adapted from the book Causes Of Catastrophe by L. Don Leet .
"But don't tell that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh , especially in a saloon on Saturday night ."
"Outside of combat , he couldn't have landed in a tougher spot ."
"In combat , helping your CO make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed ."
"But in maneuvers , with the top brass watching him all the time , it's easy ."
"But his first few days with Troop H were full of surprises , beginning with First Sergeant Robert Early ."
There was no weapon Early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded .
"Further , he had taken full advantage of the Army's correspondence courses ."
"He not only knew soldiering , but mathematics , history and literature as well ."
"But for all his erudite confidence , Sergeant Early was right out of the Garryowen mold ."
He fed the captain bits of history about the troops and the regiment .
"The faces belonged to Lieutenant Marvin Goulding , his wife and their two children ."
"And when the singing began , it was the Gouldings who sang the old Irish songs the best ."
It was no coincidence that Goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders in the regiment .
He set out to keep Troop H the best troop in the best regiment .
From then on the Fighting Seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting in Korea .
"One night on the Naktong River , Mel Chandler called on that fabled esprit de corps ."
"The troopers knew an attack was coming , but they didn't know when , and they didn't know where ."
"First came the cannon fodder , white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive human battering ram ."
"They were followed by crack North Korean troops , who mounted one charge after another ."
Another force flanked the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear .
"One of the more seriously wounded was Lieutenant Carroll , the young officer bucking for the Regular Army ."
Chandler left Carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight .
"He took one step , two , broke into a trot and then into a run ."
"His followers shouted the old battle cry after him and charged the hill , firing as they ran ."
"It was Bob Carroll , who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of Garryowen ."
But an enemy grenade hit Carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously .
"They found it at the junction between Troops H and G , and prepared to counterattack ."
"Goulding leaped to his feet and started forward , `` Garryowen '' ! !"
But the bullets whacked home before he finished his battle cry and Marvin Goulding fell dead .
That finished the job that Captain Chandler and Lieutenant Carroll had begun .
Goulding's platoon pushed back the enemy soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack .
Reinforcements came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by Goulding's platoon .
The North Koreans threw away their guns and fled across the rice paddies .
Artillery and air strikes were called in to kill them by the hundreds .
"Though Bob Carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade , he lived ."
For nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment .
"It follows that victory over Communism is the dominant , proximate goal of American policy ."
"but if we must choose between peace and keeping the Communists out of Berlin , then we must fight ."
"Freedom , in the sense of self-determination , is a worthy objective ; ;"
"This brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power ."
The first was that America had become -- or was in danger of becoming -- a second-rate military power .
I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention .
Overwhelming Russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast .
The other charge was that America's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years .
The argument was typically advanced in terms of U.S. `` prestige '' .
"Prestige , however , is only a minor part of the problem ; ;"
"and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading ."
"Prestige is a measure of how other people think of you , well or ill ."
"But contrary to what was implied during the campaign , prestige is surely not important for its own sake ."
"This ignorant estimate , I repeat , is not of any interest in itself ; ;"
And is Western influence greater or less than it used to be ? ?
"Communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages ."
"Thus , typically , the first stage of a Communist takeover is to `` neutralize '' a country ."
"Six years ago French Indochina , though in troubie , was in the Western camp ."
"Indonesia , in the early days of the Republic , leaned toward the West ."
Ceylon has moved from a pro-Western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the West .
Latin America was once an area as `` safe '' for the West as Nebraska was for Nixon .
"One Latin American country , Cuba , has become a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast ."
Only in Europe have our lines remained firm -- and there only on the surface .
"The strains of neutralism are running strong , notably in England , and even in Germany ."
We have had opportunities -- clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the Iron Curtain .
"There was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised and mourned , but did nothing about ."
There was the Polish Revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable to Soviet interests .
There was the revolution in Tibet which we pretended did not exist .
Only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power : in Guatemala .
"The young man spoke steadily enough , but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven ."
"Amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons , I heard the thumping of mortars ."
"Better stay in the hotel lobby , where the walls looked good and thick ."
Chinese and Indian merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters .
A restaurant posted a reminder to patrons `` who became excited and left without paying their checks '' .
But everyone I met had sought cover first and asked questions later .
I saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets .
In place of the police headquarters was a new square filled with rubble .
Mortars had demolished the defense ministry and set fire to the American Embassy next door .
What had been the ambassador's suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick .
"And now , in March , all Laos suffered a state of siege ."
The Pathet Lao forces held two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more .
Throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush and death .
We talked after I hailed his Jeep marked with the U.N. flag .
yet they include peoples as different from one another as Oregonians are from Patagonians .
"faith in the Buddha and staying at peace with the phis , the spirits ; ;"
"Shy , slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with the frangipani by the wayside ."
Yet Laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen around the globe .
"The Pathet Lao , stiffened by Communist Veterans from neighboring North Viet Nam , were supplied by Soviet aircraft ."
"The Royal Lao Army , on the other hand , was paid and equipped with American funds ."
We flew in rickety planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn't crash .
"Before the airplanes came , he said , travel in Laos was just about impossible ."
"Nobody wanted Americans to be hurt or captured , and few soldiers could be spared as escorts ."
Everyone had heard of the American contractor who had spurned an escort .
"With our company of soldiers , we made one long column of reddish dust ."
"An hour of bouncing , a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or dispensary ."
"More bouncing , another stop , a new house for teachers , a new well ."
"Mr. Keo , once a diplomat in Paris and Washington , was Commissioner of Rural Affairs ."
"`` We ask the people what they want , and they supply the labor ."
"We send shovels , cement , nails , and corrugated iron for roofs ."
"`` Our people have been used to accepting things as they found them '' , he said ."
"Now they learn that men can change their surroundings , through their traditional village elders , without violence ."
"Briefly we rolled over a paved road up to Pak Song , on the cool Bolovens Plateau ."
"In the village of Soukhouma , which means `` Peaceful '' , we had a baci ."
"The candles were lighted , and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village notables ."
Now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to come and join us .
"Those souls like to wander off , and must be called back ."
"With the divinities present and our souls in place , we were wished health , happiness , and power ."
"Then , one after another , the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings around our wrists ."
"John said : `` I have some antiseptic salve with me , but it's too late for that '' ."
My interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds .
"`` Being Jewish gives you tremendous drive '' , a boy remarked ."
"As I see it , there's no real difference between being Jewish , Catholic , or Protestant '' ."
Still another boy asserted : `` To be a good Jew is to do no wrong ; ;
The reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked force and authority even in the teen-agers' minds .
`` We were brought up that way '' was one statement which won general assent .
Another girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as `` the only Orthodox girl in town '' .
One of the significant things about Jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented .
Sixty-five per cent of the Jewish teen-agers of college age attend institutions of higher learning .
This may help explain a phenomenon described by a small-town Jewish boy .
The percentage of Jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys .
"The motivations for both sexes , to be sure , are different ."
One of the significant developments in American-Jewish life is that the cultural consumers are largely the women .
It is they who read -- and make -- Jewish best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them .
"In upper teen Jewish life , the non-college group tends to have a sense of marginality ."
"`` People automatically assume that I'm in college '' , a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably ."
"However , among the girls , there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going to college ."
"This is particularly true in large centers of Jewish population like New York , Chicago , and Philadelphia ."
"First , the girl's education has a lower priority than the son's ."
"Second , the attitude in Jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son ."
The consequence of this is that the girls at Brooklyn College outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically .
One can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town .
This is particularly acute for those who attended Midwood High School directly across the street from Brooklyn College .
"They have a sense of marginality at being denied that special badge of status , the out-of-town school ."
"`` It's people of your own kind '' , a girl remarked ."
"`` As long as I'm home , I'll never grow up '' , a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly ."
`` They don't like it if I do anything away from home .
Parents will drive on Friday night to pick up their daughters after a sorority or House Plan meeting .
The domestic tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field .
"Brooklyn College is Marjorie Morningstar territory , as much as the Bronx or Central Park West ."
"`` Almost everybody in the senior class is married '' , students say dogmatically ."
"These announcements are , in effect , advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage marts ."
`` Witt House happily announces the engagement of Fran Horowitz to Erwin Schwartz of Fife House '' .
The Brooklyn College student shows some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models .
The Fort Lauderdale encampment for drinking is foreign to most Brooklyn College boys .
Or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts .
`` Female troubles '' of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the frontier ; ;
"Another swore by vinegar baths for burns , and still another recommended salted butter ."
"`` Butter salve '' or `` butter ointment '' was used for burns , and for bruises as well ."
This was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil ; ;
"when it was cool , the fat was skimmed off and bottled ."
"Cow's milk was another cure for burns , and burns covered with gum arabic or plain mucilage healed quickly ."
"The results were good , but which treatment helped is still not known ."
My lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy for cuts and wounds ; ;
He showed me one of his fingers which had been practically amputated and which his mother had treated ; ;
A `` chaw '' of tobacco put on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing .
Or a thin slice of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing .
Then he put a rag around the dressing to keep it in place .
"Veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding , and rue was an antiseptic ."
"Until quite recently , `` sterile '' maggots could be bought to apply to a wound ; ;"
"they would feed on its surface , leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated ."
Another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the wounded foot or hand in the smoke .
Rabies were cured or prevented by `` madstones '' which the pioneer wore or carried .
"Another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds , then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker ."
"Since a fall or blow might have caused it , a cold pack was usually first aid ."
Old sores could be healed by the constant application of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water .
Blood blisters could be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with any hard nonpoisonous substance .
this mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around the affected part .
"`` get a bite , spit on it '' was a proverb ."
Yellow clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings ; ;
Chiggers were a common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived ; ;
"so small as to be scarcely visible to the eye , they buried themselves in the victim's flesh ."
Bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief and also killed the pests .
For mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half a glass of soda was made .
"For wasp stings onion juice , obtained by scraping an onion , gave quick relief ."
A handier remedy was to bathe the painful part in strong soapy water ; ;
Just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve wasp or bee stings .
"A kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment , but it did the job ."
To remove an insect from one's ear warm water should be inserted .
A cinder or other small object could be removed from the eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye .
Another way to remove small objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed ; ;
"Shingles were cured by gentian , an old drug , used in combinations ."
"Itching skin , considered `` just nerves '' , was eased by treating with whiskey and salt ."
Winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped .
Six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and had defied other remedies .
Frostbite was treated by putting the feet and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow .
"Another remedy was oil of eucalyptus , used as well for chilblains ."
A German informant gave me a sure cure made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice .
"Another frequent pioneer difficulty , caused by wearing rough and heavy shoes and boots , was corns ."
Saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's sleep was considered poisonous ; ;
One wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy .
One person recommended to me washing the wart with sulphur water ; ;
another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato three times daily .
the onion was then fastened together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave .
One doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy before each meal for leg cramps .
"In instances where both of these are persons or firms with integrity , the situation is ideal ."
"The Grands Crus are expensive , and even doting palates tire of them ."
There is nothing infra dig about a good blend from a good shipper .
"especially if one is travelling or dining out a great deal , their importance mounts ."
"Only then , perhaps , will he reveal his jewels and his bargains ."
Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served .
Wine stored for a long time should be on its side ; ;
"Too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks , again with ill effects ."
Seasonal rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine : they age it prematurely .
"consequently , one's wine closet or cellar should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces ."
"This invariably effaces any wine's character , and drives its fragrance underground ."
"White wines should be opened when served , having been previously chilled in proportion to their sweetness ."
but the first glass of Chateau d'Yquem or Montrachet is a great deal better than the last '' ! !
"If this must be done , they should always be corked and kept in a cool place ; ;"
it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably shorter than those of milk .
"A few red wines , notably those of the Beaujolais , are better consumed at cellar temperature ."
"Thus , red wine must , if possible , never be disturbed or shaken ; ;"
"The cork should be pulled gradually and smoothly , and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward ."
it may also be -- practically speaking -- a matter of good economy .
Red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep longer ; ;
"the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite number , red Burgundy ."
"Most of the wines of Beaujolais , on the other hand , should be drunk while very young ; ;"
The slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under John Palfrey's overseer .
"Henry hid his annoyance , although both he and William were furious with their Yankee brother ."
Their having family ties on our plantation & the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement '' .
"Of the fifty-two slaves , Giffen succeeded in getting a lot of twenty , twelve of whom were females ."
I have also taken the old servants of your father as a matter of Conscience & Justice '' .
"Each human being , known only by a given name , had a cash value ."
Giffen extracted one concession from William : the house servants could be free at any time Gorham thought expedient .
"Despite Giffen's warning , Palfrey still had plans for freeing his slaves in Louisiana ."
According to state law a slave had to be at least thirty years old before he could be freed .
"In view of these difficulties , Palfrey decided to go to Louisiana ."
"Giffen had already urged him to journey south , if only for a few days to clear up matters ."
His duties as Massachusetts Secretary of State obliged him to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-April .
In both cases he desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived in the North .
"Despite his apprehensions about his personal safety , Palfrey's reception in New Orleans was more than cordial ."
The memory of this southern hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years and Civil War .
"The women by remaining behind condemned their children , born and unborn , to bondage ."
"Only one objected , but Palfrey soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others ."
"From Cambridge , Palfrey maintained a close interest in the welfare of his slaves ."
"In fact , as the time for their departure approached , his solicitousness increased ."
"Should any slave change his mind and request to leave earlier , Giffen was to provide passage at once ."
Giffen assured him that the captain and his mate had personally promised to treat the Negroes with consideration .
Giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation for a year's work ; ;
the new owner at Attakapas declined to enter into any philanthropic arrangement .
Giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants .
"When the Negroes landed at Boston a month later they were , of course , no longer slaves ."
"Nevertheless , Palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at King's Chapel to formalize the emancipation ."
But certainly the New Frontier has brought to Washington a group more varied in background and interest .
"Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon owns a prize Monet , Femmes dans un Jardin ."
"Unlike Wilson , who at times seemed almost anti-intellectual in his earthy pragmatism ."
"Another , Arthur M. Schlesinger , Jr. , has won a Pulitzer Prize in history ; ;"
"The Press Secretary , Pierre Salinger , was a child prodigy as a pianist ."
"( `` Artists are always at a new frontier '' , she claims ."
"`` In fact , the search is almost more important than the find '' ."
"Walton , after a wartime stint with Time-Life , to become bureau chief for The New Republic ."
"Both lived in Georgetown , were unattached , and shared an active social life ."
"During last year's campaign , Kennedy asked Walton , an utter novice in organization politics , to assist him ."
Udall argues that Interior affairs should cover a great deal more than dams and wildlife preserves .
"His Ideas in this respect , however , sometimes arouse critical response ."
"There have been indications that he hopes to redress that situation , commencing with the White House ."
The press releases emanating from the White House give a clue to the activity within .
The American Institute of Interior Designers is redecorating the White House library .
Woman's place is in the home : man must attend to matters of the yard .
"More importantly , he also happens to be the brother-in-law of Sam Rayburn , Speaker of the House ."
"The Dolley Madison House , Walton concluded , was scarcely worth preserving ."
"The Dartmouth student does not live in monastic seclusion , as he once did ."
"He is still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence , if he chooses to be ."
The men's shops on Hanover's Main Street compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven .
The would-be sophisticate and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment .
And this gives rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere in the Ivy League .
This carefree disdain for `` side '' cropped up again in the same television broadcast .
"Dean Thaddeus Seymour , wearing ski clothes , was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the Carnival ."
She must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown on her head .
"Dartmouth students ski everywhere in winter , starting with their own front door ."
Probably a lawyer once said it best for all time in the Supreme Court of the United States .
"It fixed on Dartmouth College , which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered ."
For a time there were two factions on the campus fighting for possession of the student body .
"Dartmouth is today still a small college -- and still a private one , thanks to Webster's eloquence ."
"It was a hardy undertaking , and Wheelock's was indeed `` a voice crying in the wilderness '' ."
The exuberance on this occasion set a standard for subsequent Dartmouth gatherings .
"The dormitories , including the beloved Dartmouth Hall , could barely house two hundred students in Spartan fashion ."
He transformed Dartmouth from a small New Hampshire institution into a national college .
"Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today , with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates ."
"it is , in fact , the only college in the Ivy group ."
"All three are purposely kept small , with a current total enrollment of about two hundred ."
So Dartmouth is moving closer to the others in the Ivy group .
It has not been a well-known school for any part of the span the other Ivies have enjoyed .
Today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions might consider somewhat breathtaking .
"There are , of course , many weaknesses in any case against Emma ."
She had no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed .
She would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during her travels .
"If she avoided the train and hired a buggy , the stableman might have recognized her ."
It is evident that Lizzie did not tell everything she overheard between her father and her Uncle Morse .
At that time Jennings had a young law associate named Arthur S. Phillips .
It was obviously the sound of this argument that caused Lizzie to close her door .
"Notice , Knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a conviction in the trial of Lizzie Borden ."
They were a vagabond lot and considered to be shady and undesirable characters .
The screen door was unlocked for some ten or fifteen minutes while Bridget was sick in the back .
Mrs. Borden would not have been alarmed if she saw Morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand .
What did Pearson say about Bridget Sullivan as a possible suspect in his trial-book essay ? ?
`` The police soon ceased to look upon either Bridget or Mr. Morse as in possession of guilty knowledge .
"indeed , it was probably to Mr. Morse's advantage to have Mr. and Mrs. Borden alive ."
That was his complete discussion of Bridget Sullivan as a possible suspect .
"And , much as she detested Hiram Harrington , she also did not accuse him ."
"She replied , `` I know of one man that has not been friendly with him ."
"Kirby was , of course , reflecting the opinion that existed at the time of murders ."
Her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad interests .
There is clear evidence that Lucy from childhood had an unusual mind .
"She possessed an observant eye , a retentive memory , and a critical faculty ."
"When she was nine years old , she wrote a description of a store she had visited ."
and she had an appetite for learning that could not be denied .
"Do you think I might profitably study some of the history you do , perhaps two weeks behind you ."
"Whatever was the science in the high school course for the time being , that was my favorite study ."
"She read Maitland's Dark Ages , `` which I enjoyed very much '' ; ;"
She discussed in her letters to Winslow some of the questions that came to her as she studied alone .
Lucy's correspondence with brother Winslow during his college days was not entirely taken up with academic studies .
At different times he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist .
And it was Lucy Upton who first started the idea of a regular course in Music at Spelman College .
For three years he was connected with the U.S. Naval Observatory and with the U.S. Signal Corps ; ;
What was called an `` accidental meeting '' with Miss Packard in Washington turned her attention to Spelman .
She served for a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance .
"and as graduates gratefully recall , she drew on her purse as well ."
"Many a student was able to remain at Spelman , only because of her unobtrusive help ."
"Miss Upton and Miss Packard , as a matter of fact , had many tastes in common ."
She noted that no student had been withdrawn through loss of confidence ; ;
that the enrollment showed an increase of boarding students as was desired ; ;
"With the Fund in hand , the debt on the boilers had been paid ; ;"
"The daughters of Spelman , she said , had never known or thought of Spelman without her ."
"and when school closed , she was unable to travel to Massachusetts ."
She was closely associated with the Founders in all their trials and hardships .
"Quiet and energetic , cheerful and calm , she too was a power in the development of the seminary ."
Miss Giles always used to refer to her as `` Sister '' .
In a few school districts one finds a link between school and job .
In both cases the student attends school half-time and works in a regular job the other half .
"If the student drops out of high school , the break with the school is even more complete ."
But in the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent .
Undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools .
And the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership .
This is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the Northern universities .
"I believe the situation is improving , but the success stories need to be heavily publicized ."
I should like to underline four points I made in my first report with respect to vocational education .
"however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to begin earlier ."
"Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; ;"
"Fourth , the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality ."
I intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls .
These courses develop skills other than those we think of when we use the adjective `` academic '' .
They are in this sense skills marketable immediately on graduation from high school .
"So , too , is the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics ."
Perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which proves the rule .
Most of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools .
He prefers to designate such schools as `` general '' high schools .
The reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community .
The separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions .
`` What does he have in mind to do when he graduates '' ? ?
"`` Oh , he'll be a plumber '' , came the answer ."
`` But isn't it almost impossible to get into the union '' ? ?
I discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were Negroes .
"The physical facilities at Dunbar are impressive , but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils ."
The soybean seed is the most important leguminous food in the world .
Soybeans are extensively processed into a remarkable number of food products in the Orient .
"We produce peanut oil , but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed ."
Most of the grain is fed to swine and dairy cows and lesser amounts to beef cattle and poultry .
"These oils develop hard , smooth films when they dry and form resinlike substances ."
"Seeds of soybean , cotton , corn , sesame , and rape yield semidrying oils ."
Palm oil protects the surfaces of steel sheets before they are plated with tin .
"Castor oil , made from castorbeans , has gone out of style as a medicine ."
"Almond oil , another nondrying oil , was once used extensively in perfumery to extract flower fragrances ."
Seeds are a main source of starch for industrial and food use in many parts of the world .
"Corn and wheat supply most of the starch in the United States , Canada , and Australia ."
Locust gum is added to pulp slurries to break up the lumps of fibers in making paper .
Almonds and pistachio nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein .
"the soap nut , which owes its sudsing power to natural saponins ; ;"
A forest crop that has not been extensively cultivated is ivory nuts from the tagua palm .
The so-called vegetable ivory is the hard endosperm of the egg-sized seed .
"It is used for making buttons and other small , hard objects of turnery ."
Seeds of the sago palm are used in Bermuda to make heads and faces of dolls sold to tourists .
The color and shape of seeds have long made them attractive for ornaments and decorations .
"Since Biblical times , rosaries have been made from jobs-tears -- the seeds of an Asiatic grass ."
Bead tree seeds are the necklaces of South Pacific islanders and the eyes of Buddha dolls in Cuba .
Victorian ladies had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry .
Handmade Christmas wreaths and trees often contain a variety of seeds collected during the year .
"Tradition has assigned medicinal values to seeds because of their alkaloids , aromatic oils , and highly flavored components ."
Peanut and sesame oils often are used as carriers or diluents for medicines administered by injection .
"The common spices , flavorings , and condiments make up this group ."
Less common seeds used in cooking and beverages include fenugreek ( artificial maple flavor ) and cardamom .
White pepper is the ground seed of the common black pepper fruit .
"It is a main flavoring for halvah , the candy of the Middle East ."
Coffee is made from the roasted and ground seeds of the coffee tree .
"Cocoa , chocolate , and cocoa butter come from the ground seeds of the cacao tree ."
"Beer , generally fermented from barley , is an old alcoholic beverage ."
"Distillers use corn , malt , wheat , grain sorghum , and rye in making beverage alcohol ."
Seed crops hold a prominent place in the agricultural economy of the United States .
To keep 'em scattered somewhat and yet herd 'em was called `` loose herdin' '' .
To hold 'em in a compact mass was `` close herdin' '' .
Cattle were inclined to remain in a territory with which they were acquainted .
"Yet there were always some that moved farther and farther out , seekin' grass and water ."
Cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till it was over .
"you had to go with 'em or wait till the storm was over , and follow ."
The cowboy made a technical distinction in reference to the number of them animals .
The single animal or a small bunch were referred to as `` strays '' ; ;
Cattle which died from them winter storms were referred to as the `` winter kill '' .
When cattle in winter stopped and humped their backs up they were said to `` bow up '' .
Cattle brought into a range from a distance were called `` immigrants '' .
Them new to the country were referred to as `` pilgrims '' .
A `` cattaloe '' was a hybrid offspring of buffalo and cattle .
"`` Dry stock '' denoted , regardless of age or sex , such bovines as were givin' no milk ."
The cowboy's humorous name for a cow givin' milk was a `` milk pitcher '' .
`` Shootin' 'em out '' was gettin' cattle out of a corral onto the range .
They were said to be `` on their heads '' when grazin' .
The first cattle the Injuns saw under the white man's control were the ox teams of the early freighters .
`` Tailin' '' was the throwin' of an animal by the tail in lieu of a rope .
"This throwed the animal off balance , and over it'd crash onto its head and shoulders ."
It required both a quick and swift hoss and a darin' rider .
"When the cowboy used the word `` tailin's '' , he meant stragglers ."
`` Bull tailin' '' was a game once pop'lar with the Mexican cowboys of Texas .
Rammin' one horn of a downed steer into the ground to hold 'im down was called `` peggin' '' .
`` Sabinas '' was a Spanish word used to describe cattle of red and white peppered and splotched colorin' .
`` Yeller bellies '' were cattle of Mexican breed splotched on flank and belly with yellerish color .
Them notes and mortgages were spoken of as `` cattle paper '' .
This led to the famous sayin' in the Northwest of the `` books won't freeze '' .
The origin of this sayin' was credited to a saloonkeeper by the name of Luke Murrin .
He stifled the Comanche yell and let John lead him straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain .
On the south it ended sharply as though the lava had been cut off there suddenly .
"`` That's the Colonel '' , he said , `` But I can't see the dogs '' ."
Then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front of him .
"Jones was galloping close behind them leaning down , cheering them on ."
"He threw green stuff on it , and a thin blue column of smoke rose ."
`` That will fetch the gang and tell the Colonel where we are '' .
Kearton and Ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound .
It came from the top of the Reef not half a mile away .
"At the base of the rocky hillside , they left their horses and climbed on foot ."
"Of the thirty-four , seventeen had been killed by lions , and eleven out of the seventeen by lionesses ."
"Even then , if she took one step forward he could catch her ."
"while Jones , on the other hand , appeared perfectly confident and Ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer ."
"Although she appeared more subdued and defeated , Jones knew she was growing more dangerous ."
The dogs followed her and she killed three and badly wounded Old John .
For such an emergency he had included Fourth-of-July cannon crackers as part of their equipment .
"Lighting one he pitched it into the crevice , and the lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed ."
"But she clung to the rocks and brush , and the day wore away ."
At this moment she was crouched in a cave-like aperture halfway down the Reef .
"John led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out behind , many of them trailing blood ."
"With the gully on three sides , she could be approached only along the tongue of land ."
"A Western cowpony had outrun an African lion , from a standing start ."
"The lioness quickly changed front , when she saw she couldn't catch Means , and made for Jones ."
Somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the determining point .
"This new position , however , gave the ropers a better chance ."
There was room to make a quick dash past the bush and throw as you went .
"So : Means edged around on the north side of her , Jones moved in from the south ."
"Kearton began shouting , `` Wait , wait -- the camera's jammed '' ! !"
"As long as this point of view prevails , the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt ."
The next stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community .
The front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping congregations of different traditions exist side by side .
It is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical .
The idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken .
How far the fellowship in most local churches falls below what the New Testament means by koinonia ! !
The koinonia of Acts and of the Epistles means sharing in a common relation to Christ .
The antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists .
Each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related to the other .
"As things stand now , the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other ."
They do not escape the pitfall into which Charles Dickens pictured Mrs. Jellyby as falling .
The parish lives for itself rather than for the community or the world .
Its preaching and its music give refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain .
And it is easy for the ecumenical enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is .
It is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with the mind of Christ .
It is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy .
It is not making them sensitive to the sub-Christian level of much of our economic and industrial life .
It is not disturbing them by thoughts of their Christian responsibility in relation to the world .
"He built a school and a library , then a recreation center and an inn ."
"His face was always in the newspapers , sometimes in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life ."
"Lou Gehrig was given the nickname Buster , and he ran Ruth a close race in home runs ."
He was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond ; ;
There were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down ; ;
or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without pausing for breath .
But the twenties were not all insanity and a striving after recognition .
The adolescent experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs. time diffusion .
Others displayed utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future .
The adolescent experiences two closely related crises : self-certainty vs. an identity consciousness ; ;
Another identity crisis confronting the adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs. work-paralysis .
"If she has not had such experiences , the female's normal adolescent degree of indecision will be compounded ."
whether to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself while attending school ; ;
whether to pursue a college education or a job after high school ; ;
and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study .
They attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions others made ; ;
"they accepted a job primarily because it was available , convenient , and paid reasonably ."
"As their identity diffusion increased , they became more susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs ."
"The excerpts from case histories presented above confirm this significance , though through different facets of experience ."
they subsequently occupied their leisure hours in searching for something exciting and diverting .
The adolescent also faces the identity crisis that Erikson has termed ideological polarization vs. diffusion of ideals .
"This tendency is , perhaps , most clearly revealed in the literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents ."
They were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital sexual intercourse .
They condemned the movie script writers for implying that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating .
They criticized parents for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong ; ;
"In the final accounting , these would have augmented the bill for both sides ."
Chief among the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures in equity .
"Parker , who agreed with much of this criticism , did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects ."
"The suit , although commonly designated as a single action , actually embraced five cases ."
Parker listed the remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony .
The most important of these found him in agreement with Hough's plea for reform .
"Other expeditious methods are designed to prevent prolixity , limit delays , and reduce the expense of infringement suits ."
The fluidity and momentum of the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims .
One of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition upon the withholding of patent rights among A.L.A.M. members .
"Within its limits , this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics of a cross-licensing agreement ."
Its positive features outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly .
The highly important Dyer patents on the sliding gear transmission were held by the A.L.A.M. pool .
Occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain prospect of legal complications .
"The breach created by the Selden patent doomed his proposal , but Hanch did not abandon his scheme ."
"After the demise of the A.L.A.M. , the time was propitious for establishing such a pool ."
Most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal interchange of patents .
"The plan was supported by Frederick P. Fish , counsel for the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce ."
He was well aware that some inventors and their allies used their patents solely for nuisance value .
The eloquent persuasions of Fish guaranteed the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association .
Continue another hundred yards to the Piazza of the Knights of Malta .
On the wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments .
The massive gate of the Maltese villa affords one of the most extraordinary views in Rome .
Here you can pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city .
"You will walk some of the narrow , old streets , hemmed in by massive palazzi ."
Start on the Via D. Teatro Di Marcello at the foot of the Capitoline Hill .
Wander past the three superb Columns of Apollo by the arches of the theatre .
The remains of the Portico of Octavia are now in front of you .
The figures have been executed so skillfully that one senses a great feeling of life and movement .
"Opposite is the Palazzo Mattei , one of Rome's oldest palaces , now the headquarters of the Italo-American Association ."
"The Palazzo Caetani , still inhabited by the Caetani family , adjoins the Palazzo Mattei ."
Follow the colorful and busy Via D. Giubbonari for a hundred yards or so .
Now turn left at the Via dell' Arco Del Monte to the Piazza Dei Pellegrini .
The great architect also designed the fine interior staircase and colonnade which connects the two courts .
"By tipping the porter , you can see in the courtyard Borromini's unusual and fascinating trick in perspective ."
"The gardens of the palazzo , shaded by a huge magnolia tree , are most attractive ."
Michelangelo was the most distinguished of several noted architects who helped design it .
Ask to see the modern tapestries of Paris and Rome designed by Lurcat .
"Today , by contrast it is a lively and colorful fruit , vegetable , and flower market ."
For centuries it was the location of historic festivals and open-air sports events .
The scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about Rome .
Inside you will find the lovely Sibyls painted by Raphael and a chapel designed by Michelangelo .
Now return to the Piazza Navona and leave it on the opposite side by the Corsia Agonale ; ;
"In front of you is the Palazzo Madama , once belonging to the Medici and now the Italian Senate ."
"The Pantheon's interior , still in its original form , is truly majestic and an architectural triumph ."
Its rotunda forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from the floor to the ceiling .
The only means of interior light is the twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous dome .
This is one of the most charming little squares in this part of Rome .
"A few yards farther , on the Via Dei Bergamaschi , is the Piazza Colonna ."
The great column from which the square takes its name was erected by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius .
"You are now at the Corso , though narrow , one of Rome's busiest streets ."
Here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where the family still lives .
"Otherwise , cross over the Corso and walk a block or so to the left ."
"He has never , himself , done anything for which to be hated -- which of us has ? ?"
"He moves through Harlem , therefore , like an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country ; ;"
"Even if he is gifted with the merest mustard grain of imagination , something must seep in ."
He knows that he certainly does not want his children living this way .
"One day , to everyone's astonishment , someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything blows up ."
"Negroes want to be treated like men : a perfectly straightforward statement , containing only seven words ."
I once tried to describe to a very well-known American intellectual the conditions among Negroes in the South .
"I tried to explain what has happened , unfailingly , whenever a significant body of Negroes move North ."
"They do not escape Jim Crow : they merely encounter another , not-less-deadly variety ."
"They do not move to Chicago , they move to the South Side ; ;"
"they do not move to New York , they move to Harlem ."
"The pressure within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand , and this expansion is always violent ."
and what has once been a neighborhood turns into a `` turf '' .
He was born in the North and did his military training in the South .
"He did not , as far as I can gather , find the South `` worse '' ; ;"
but I do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification for our own crimes .
"The emptier our hearts become , the greater will be our crimes ."
"Historically , the flaming sword laid across this Eden is the Civil War ."
"Everything , thereafter , is permitted him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need ."
"The resulting , indescribable torment affects every Southern mind and is the basis of the Southern hysteria ."
"Negroes represent nothing to him personally , except , perhaps , the dangers of carnality ."
Northerners never think about them whereas Southerners are never really thinking of anything else .
Neither the Southerner nor the Northerner is able to look on the Negro simply as a man .
The country will not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really means by freedom .
"Walk through the streets of Harlem and see what we , this nation , have become ."
"Stevenson stated , in the course of his address , that the United States was `` against '' colonialism ."
"However , the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the U.N. gallery ."
It is a view which even a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict .
"One has only , for example , to walk through Harlem and ask oneself two questions ."
The first question is : Would I like to live here ? ?
And the second question is : Why don't those who now live here move out ? ?
"Wherever there is great social discontent , these people are , sooner or later , to be found ."
Their presence is not as frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity .
Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties .
"Each film consisted of fifty feet , which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen ."
"As long as audiences came to see the movement , there seemed little reason to adventure further ."
"Brief snips of actual events were shown : parades , dances , street scenes ."
"An early Edison production was The Execution Of Mary , Queen Of Scots ."
"As the first scene begins to fade , the succeeding scene begins to appear ."
"For a moment or two , both scenes are present simultaneously , one growing weaker , one growing stronger ."
"Linking the smoothly changing images together , the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement ."
"Time is built into the motion picture , which cannot exist without time ."
"In narrative , time is essential , as it is in film ."
"This discovery of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician's tricks produced on film ."
"Overnight , for one thing , Porter's film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten ."
The reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies .
"Cutting , of course , takes place automatically in the creation of a film ."
"The meaning of the word is quite physical , to begin with ."
Before he was forty Griffith had created the art of the film .
"Not that there had not been attempts , mostly European , to do exactly that ."
But no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies .
"In general , religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis ; ;"
A congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership ; ;
the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition .
"With few exceptions , the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city ."
"The key to Protestant development , therefore , is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation ."
"but this is deceptive , for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum ."
The congregation perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood ; ;
"in fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the `` impersonal '' Roman Catholic parish ."
We have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers ; ;
The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations .
"A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism ."
"If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration ."
( Co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy ; ;
it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization .
") In a mobile society , congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment ; ;"
"this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; ;"
Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; ;
the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position ; ;
association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations .
"once the pool of recruits diminishes , the congregation is helpless -- friendly contacts no longer keep it going ."
economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which Protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood .
"nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant development ."
The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized ; ;
The accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations .
This conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment .
"Negroes , Puerto Ricans , and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities ."
"It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity , since worship presupposes some local stabilities ."
Attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches ; ;
this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes .
The keynotes of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem .
`` Fellowship by likeness '' and `` mission by friendly contact '' form the iron cage of denominational religion .
"Its contents are another matter , for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation ."
"With capital largely squandered , there seemed to them no other course to pursue ."
"The company disposed of the pelts , but with what profit , the records do not show ."
"Traders from the English colonies were far more generous , and Indian loyalty turned to them ."
They adopted a program by which Louisiana was divided into five districts .
"West of the Mobile district was the lower Mississippi district , of which New Orleans was headquarters ."
Dependent upon it were posts on the lower Mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers of New Spain .
On the middle Mississippi a principal post was to be located near the mouth of the Arkansas .
Other posts would be established up the Ohio and Wabash to protect communication with Canada .
"Each of the five principal posts was to have a director , responsible to a director-general at New Orleans ."
The habitants were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose of their pelts to the concessionaires .
"Only two principal storehouses were actually established -- one at Mobile , the other at New Orleans ."
Mobile was also supplied by New Orleans with goods for the Mobile district .
The power that Bienville exercised during his first administration cannot be determined .
The Alabama and Tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and cheaply .
The Chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the Mobile district .
The Chickasaws finally were the occasion for the most disastrous wars during the French control of Louisiana .
To the directors the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy .
Perier attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among the Indians .
"These agents were to ascertain the difference between English and French goods , and the prices charged the Indians ."
"So hostile did these factions become that , among the Choctaws , civil war broke out ."
"In spite of the company's restrictions , he planned to build new posts in the territory ."
He asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the Indians' pelts .
"D'Artaguette went vigorously to work , and gave credit to many hunters ."
"With the loss of the Mobile trade , which ended all profits from Louisiana , the Natchez Indians revolted ."
"They destroyed a trading house and pillaged the goods , and harassed French shipping on the Mississippi ."
The war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts .
"It offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade , but asked an indemnity ."
"Company rule in Louisiana left the colony without fortifications , arms , munitions , or supplies ."
"Others left the country , and there was no one familiar with the Indian trade ."
"He did find some to trust , however , and he employed the King's soldiers to trade ."
"With no company to interfere , he kept close control over all the traders ."
"In order to compete with English traders , Bienville radically changed the price schedule ."
They would be particularly displeased with the State Department if it were the source of such reports .
Few things are more perilous for the State Department than a displeased congressman .
"First , the State Department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters ."
The farmers may be aroused if Congress cuts into the Agriculture Department's budget .
The congressman's patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the Defense Department .
Tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every voter who can write .
"With all these agencies , the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly ."
No such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon the State Department in anger .
In many sections he may even reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson .
People in this position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the newspapers .
The Department expects and receives no thanks from Congress for its discretion .
its embassies are expected to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way ; ;
So was the attack upon Charles E. Bohlen when Eisenhower appointed him Ambassador to Moscow .
"Where Acheson had fought a gallant losing battle for the Department , Dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates ."
"In any event , the example of Acheson's trampling by the Senate did not encourage Dulles to provoke it ."
"Their successors , absorbing the lesson , made it a point to have few ideas ."
"This , in turn , brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the Democrats took control ."
Other embassies cable home The New York Times without changing a comma .
Menshikov hit Washington with a TV announcer's grin and a hearty handclasp .
Speeches by the Soviet ambassador became the vogue as he obliged rural Maryland Rotarians and National Press Club alike .
"In Senator Joseph McCarthy's phrase , it was the most unheard-of thing ever heard of ."
"At the State Department , hard-bitten Russian experts complained that the Capitol was out of its wits ."
"Newspaper punditry was inspired to remind everyone that Judas , too , had been able to smile ."
"The most inscrutable embassies are the Arabs' , and the most inscrutable of the Arabs are the Saudi Arabians ."
"When King Saud visited Washington , the overwhelming question consuming the press was the size of his family ."
"The State Department was little help on this , or on much else about Saudi Arabia ."
"`` This is where I get my information from '' , he confided ."
The size of Saud's family was still being debated when the King appeared for his first meeting with Eisenhower .
"When it ended , a dusky sheik in desert robes flowed into Hagerty's office to report on the interview ."
The massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about Saudi-American friendship to bore in on the central question .
The sheik smiled and murmured : `` That is precisely correct '' .
Finally he reported that Nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for Israeli concessions .
I know now why our Japanese friends were surprised when they walked into our bathroom .
They are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching and learning .
"Spiritual life is cultivated , but students do not need to be Christian ."
"Because Don was leaving the next day , I spent the evening with him at Asia Center ."
There is much more freedom in the schools here than I expected -- some think too much .
There is a great deal of thought being given to the question of moral education in the schools .
There seems to be no purpose in life that is sure -- no certain guiding principles to give stability .
"As a result , money is spent quickly and freely , with no thought of its value ."
"Six of the science teachers were present , and we had great fun ."
"After a day at Nikko , Mrs. Kodama put me on the train for Kyoto ."
Kyoto is the ancient capital of Japan and still its cultural center .
We visited the Okamoto home -- where for the first time I saw the famous tea ceremony .
They were even better than those of Tokyo -- more spectacular and more imaginative .
I was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities accompanying the medical school .
"In his big home live four families and thirty people , so it needs to be big ."
He had displayed more of them than usual so that I could enjoy them .
In Nara I stayed at the hotel where the Prince and Princess had stayed on their honeymoon .
"A new red carpet had been laid for their coming , but I walked on it , too ."
Here Mr. Yoneda met us after a three-hour train trip from the town where he teaches .
"Again the plan was for me to go alone , but they wouldn't let me ."
"It is the second largest city in Japan , with about four million people ."
But there he was at the train with an Oregon State pennant in his hand .
There were no words to say this but there was no need .
The teachers of Mr. Uno's school gave me a small gift to thank me for coming .
I was grateful for their insight into my need for this experience .
Everything was in an exciting turmoil -- full of anticipation and fun .
Masu is also teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for Japanese widows in Tokyo .
They learn how to take care of children and sick members of the family .
"Although the training is only for one month , it is intensive and thorough ."
Graduates of this maid's school are much in demand and can always find work immediately .
"Then the boycott would not be secondary , but a primary one ."
"Such a general boycott might still be a blunt or indiscriminating instrument , and therefore of questionable justification ."
Action located where the evil is concentrated will prove most decisive and is most clearly legitimate .
"It is true , of course , that the end or objective of this action was different ."
"Here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance to those being despoiled , and to legal remedies ."
"and in warfare with any means , men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause ."
Here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some causes as more important than their lives ; ;
and to them it will seem insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently .
"Economy in the use of power needs not only to be asserted , but clearly specified ; ;"
Northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration .
They have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state .
The name presumably derives from the French royal house which never learned and never forgot ; ;
The nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little understood in the North .
"Most of them are Democrats and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed as , liberals ."
Yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron saints .
"I am naive , they say , to make use of such words ."
I take this to mean that the intelligent -- and therefore necessarily cynical ? ?
"The American liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case ; ;"
but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one .
"If he attaches little importance to personal liberty , why not make this known to the world ? ?"
"I am concerned here , however , with the Northern liberal's attitude toward the South ."
"'' This , for the liberals I know , would be an understatement ."
I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North .
"In business circles , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found ."
"From my wife's experience and other sources , this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles ."
"Also , among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems ."
but for this discussion the most important division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who haven't .
I suspect that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the North likes to believe .
Since the Supreme Court's decision of that year this is more doubtful ; ;
Belief in the traditional way of life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones .
Old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater than the Piedmont ; ;
The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area .
In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South .
Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors .
"Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and Reconstruction ; ;"
their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties .
"And therein , I feel , many Northerners delude themselves about the South ."
"For one thing , this is not a subject often discussed or analyzed ."
If the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true .
And the great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic descent .
"The fact is due mainly to international wars , both hot and cold ."
And there is no section of the nation more ardent than the South in the cold war against Communism .
The North should thank its stars that such has been the case ; ;
but at the same time it should not draw false inferences therefrom .
The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries .
"There is much truth in both these charges , and not many Bourbons deny them ."
"Many Northeners believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly ."
"The Bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of Northern conservatives ."
But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this .
"Their own easier , slower tempo is especially dear to Southerners ; ;"
"Speaking generally , it furthered -- and still tends to further -- the interests of the Western powers ."
That any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have astonished a nineteenth-century statesman .
Social Darwinism was able to stave off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century .
"Already firmly implanted internally , it is a growing factor in external matters ."
A little more than twenty years ago the American people turned an important corner .
A national consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts are desirable as well as necessary .
"Internal national responsibility , now a truism , need not be documented ."
That guiding principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the New Deal ; ;
Hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through planning -- the economic side of the constitutional revolution .
Internal national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the Industrial Revolution .
The idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the non-Soviet world .
"The hypothesis ventured here is that it does , and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition ."
Complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal principle of sovereignty .
"Operating side by side , together they helped shore up the nation-state ."
"While sovereignty has roots in antiquity , in its present usage it is essentially modern ."
Austin's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty still dominates much of today's legal and political thinking .
"In fact , however , both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined ."
"Nevertheless , nationalism and sovereignty are reputed , in the accepted wisdom , to describe the modern world ."
to some degree they are being supplanted by a concept of national responsibility .
"As evidence to support that view , consider the following illustrative instances ."
Are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster ? ?
There is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks .
As an Air Force psychiatrist put it : `` You can't have dry runs on this one '' .
Work is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons .
They inhabit a secret world centered on `` go codes '' and `` gold phones '' .
"One arm represented our bombers and missiles , the other arm `` theirs '' ."
"His investigations made him the Paul Revere of accidental war , and safety procedures were enormously increased ."
"The chain starts at BMEWS ( Ballistic Missile Early Warning System ) in Thule , Greenland ."
Its radar screens would register Soviet missiles shortly after they are launched against the United States .
"Multiple circuits , routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible ."
The same principle of `` redundancy '' applies to all communications on these special networks .
Hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons .
Or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the Soviets without provocation ? ?
Even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike -- the `` go code '' .
In an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the `` gold-phone circuit '' .
"The talk would not be in code , but neither would it ramble ."
"The key man almost certainly would be Col. William W. Wisman , SAC's senior controller ."
Movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts are crammed with intelligence information .
"At least a dozen men , some armed , are never far away from him ."
At General Power's seat in the balcony there is also a gold phone .
( There are two receivers in case one should be dropped and damaged .
"Now we must become vague , for we are approaching one of the nation's most guarded secrets ."
What these fragments are and how they activate the go order may not be revealed .
The pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by Wisman's staff .
I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one .
"They , too , have fragments of the go code with them ."
"Once we send out the whole pie , they can put their pieces into it ."
"Unless we send out the whole pie , their pieces mean nothing '' ."
Why does Wisman's ever-changing code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers ? ?
Each must match Wisman's `` pie '' with the fragment that he carries with him .
"They went as rigid as black statuary six figures , lean and tall and angular , went still ."
They went after the squall as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow .
I followed them in the jeep and now they did not care .
"Occasionally , for no reason that I could see , they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot ."
Sometimes I guessed it was because the rain squall had changed direction .
"Finally , avoiding hummocks and seeking low ground , they intercepted the rain squall ."
"He bent down , a black cranelike figure , and put his mouth to the ground ."
"With a lordly and generous gesture , the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows ."
There are thousands of square miles of salt pan which are hideous .
But much of the land which the aborigine wanders looks as if it should be hospitable .
"It is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush , has a peaceful quality , the hills roll softly ."
The malignancy of such a landscape has been beautifully described by the Australian Charles Bean .
They went well-equipped with everything except knowledge of the `` outback '' country .
The countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps .
There might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise ; ;
He knows that the economy of life in the `` outback '' is awful .
Any organism that falters or misperceives the signals or weakens is done .
Perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his odd air of dignity .
Many of them have drifted into the cities and towns and seaports .
"Finally , however , the arrangements were made and we drove out into the bush in a Land Rover ."
"Two miles northeast , then five miles southwest that sort of thing ."
I would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was hopeless .
"They were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder : a man , his lubra , and two children ."
"It lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving , watching us carefully ."
`` I suppose because it saves them some loss of body water .
"We drove close to the boulder , stopped the Land Rover , and walked over toward the family ."
"Every bone and muscle in his body showed , but he did not give the appearance of starving ."
The ridges over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut .
There was something about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds to realize what .
She remained squatting on her heels all the time we were there ; ;
"The tiny bodies , dropped onto a dry leaf , made a pile as big as a small apple ."
The odor here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines .
One's impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant .
"The smell is sexual , but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it ."
"as if the coating of sweat , dirt , and ashes were a cosmetic ."
`` They swear that every person smells different and every family smells different from every other .
"Idje , here '' , and he nodded at the man , `` is said to have great odor ."

These things are important to almost all Persians and perhaps most important to the most ordinary .
he sniffed the air and licked it on his lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage .
There has probably always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the city .
"For one thing , there is a natural belt of rock across the river bed ; ;"
"for another , it was here that one of the old caravan routes came in ."
From upstream it looks like a long arcaded box laid across the river ; ;
"from downstream , where the water level is much lower , it is a high , elaborately facaded pavilion ."
The top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile .
"Out of water , brick , and tile they have made far more than just a bridge ."
All kinds come to walk in the promenade : merchants from the bazaar bickering over a deal ; ;
"dervishes who stand with the stillness of the blind , their eyes filmed with rheum and visions ; ;"
"students , civil servants , beggars , musicians , hawkers , and clowns ."
Families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on carpets around a samovar .
"Below , people line the steps , as though on bleachers , to watch the sky and river ."
"And it is expressed , at least to their taste , in a perfect form ."
In most Western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the libraries and museums .
"That , at any rate , is what happens at the Khaju bridge ."
Boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade .
In this true lover's tomb interred A world of love lies sepulchred .
"This schedule became too strenuous , even for the energetic and conscientious Mr. Steinberg ."
"Yes : though not professional musicians , they were a music-loving family ."
"She even devised a system of colors , whereby the boy could easily distinguish the different note values ."
"Because , like many other children , he intensely disliked practicing Czerny Etudes , he composed his own studies ."
Steinberg claims that these early years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career .
Wasn't this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post ? ?
"No , originally he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such ."
"However , when he assumed the duties of a conductor , he relinquished his career as a pianist ."
During his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the Berlin State Opera .
During these years the youthful conductor had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in Germany .
He had presented the first German performances of Puccini's Manon Lescaut and De Falla's La Vida Breve .
"Through the Frankfurt Jewish Kulturbund he began to give sonata recitals in synagogues , with Cellist Emanuel Feuermann ."
Seven years later he was asked to become director of the Pittsburgh Symphony .
"First of all , to Italy for a short vacation -- Forte Dei Marmi , a place he loves ."
Steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about Italy : `` Rome is my second home .
The forthcoming season in Pittsburgh also promises to be of unusual interest .
Other world premieres will be Gardner Read's Third Symphony and Burle Marx's Samba Concertante .
"Of course , I shall conduct Mahler and Bruckner works in the coming season , as usual ."
"Since he introduces so much modern music , I could not resist asking how he felt about it ."
I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today '' .
"With all his musical activities , did he have the time and inclination to do anything else ? ?"
"Like his late colleague , Mitropoulos , he reads mystery stories , in particular Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ."
`` Both children are musical and my wife is a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgement '' .

what they feared most was war or political instability in their own country .
All expressed interest in world affairs but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest .
"Once again , as in the days of the Founding Fathers , America faces a stern test ."
"Accordingly , they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential sources for posterity ."
Before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary .
His bold fiscal program and his broad interpretation of the Constitution stand as durable contributions .
"As first Chief Justice , his strong nationalist opinions anticipated John Marshall ."
He ended his public career as a two-term governor of New York .
"Their social status was achieved in some cases by birth , as with Washington , Jefferson and Jay ; ;"
"Hamilton , poorest of the seven , gave up a brilliant law practice to enter Washington's Cabinet ."
To support his large family Hamilton went back to the law after each spell of public service .
Talleyrand passed his New York law office one night on the way to a party .
"Hamilton was bent over his desk , drafting a legal paper by the light of a candle ."
All seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality .
Jay had participated in the decision that exiled his old friend Van Schaack .
All seven recognized that independence was but the first step toward building a nation .
All sought the fruition of that nationalism in a Federal Government with substantial powers .
"Save Jefferson , all participated in the framing or ratification of the Federal Constitution ."
"They supported it , not as a perfect instrument , but as the best obtainable ."
Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora with her box opened ; ;
"and the disguised one , as the serpent creeping with his deadly wiles into Paradise '' ."
of the stereotyped Negro servants chanting hymns as they plow the fields ; ;
This is not to say that the South is no longer agrarian ; ;
In a mere half-century the South has more than tripled its urban status .
The effects of television and other mass media are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force .
Has the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded or unwanted ? ?
"Then came this decision , which sped the process of gaining equality ( or perhaps hindered it ; ;"
The modern Negro has not made a decisive debut into Southern fiction .
Writers openly admit that the Negro is easier to write than the white man ; ;
"but they obviously mean by this , not a Negro personality , but a Negro type ."
"and the success of such an endeavor is , as suggested above , glaringly rare ."
The book concerned with the Negro's role in an urban society is rare indeed ; ;
"recently only Keith Wheeler's novel , Peaceable Lane , has openly faced the problem ."
Perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing ; ;
"but they can hardly deny that , exaggerated or not , the old panorama is dead ."
He is too deeply steeped in William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren .
"Faulkner , for one , appears to be safe from the accusing fingers of all assailants in this regard ."
"He has made it his , and his it remains , irrevocably ."
Another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre .
"But Robert Rauschenberg , the neo-dadaist artist , has collaborated with several of them ."
Mr. Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor .
"In fact , he calls his productions dance-theatre works of motion , shape , light , and sound ."
He began with masks to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be .
The depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure .
From this being come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single unit .
"Thus , the avant-garde choreographers have extended the scope of materials available for dance composition ."
"The test of form is fidelity to the experience , a gauge also accepted by the abstract expressionist painters ."
He accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence of the vitality of the experience of creation .
The work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience .
He may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers .
"But he cannot order his elements by will , either rational or inspired ."
Musicians who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development .
"According to Katherine Litz , `` the becoming , the process of realization , is the dance '' ."
An exploration of these possible relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form to the dance .
"Looking back , Miss Marsicano feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of Jackson Pollock ."
Midi Garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement .
It is through the metamorphosed dancer that the germ of form is discovered .
The theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve .
"It may be a reaction to a percussive sound , the following movements constituting further reactions ."
Movements unfold freely because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive .
"He rejects all subjectively motivated continuity , any line of action related to the concept of cause and effect ."
He bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything .
"Chance , he finds , enables him to create `` a world beyond imagination '' ."
The sequence of movements in a Cunningham dance is unlike any sequence to be seen in life .
"nearby , another sits motionless , while still another is twirling an umbrella ."
Their consequences are irrelevant -- or there are no consequences at all .
"The sequence is determined by chance , and Mr. Cunningham makes use of any one of several chance devices ."
"However , there is always the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible to execute ."
He must rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other .
"In homely terms whose timeliness is startling today , he thus declared his own right to secede ."
"We now practically read it , all men are created equal except Negroes ."
"The Confederate Constitution copied much of the Federal Constitution verbatim , and most of the rest in substance ."
"It operated on , by and for the people individually just as did the Federal Constitution ."
Its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their Constitution .
"The only important differences from that standpoint , between the two Constitutions , lies in their Preambles ."
What Lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people were sovereign in the Union .

Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton ? ?
There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud .
And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact .
In fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other .
We are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way that people once feared comets .
They are in general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual .
But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating .
This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls .
We perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect .
The achievements which dispelled our fears of the cosmos took place three centuries ago .
"In the physical sciences , these achievements concern electricity , chemistry , and atomic physics ."
"In addition , our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed ."
How and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study .
procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory .
There are many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear .
Much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared .
The fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear I have tried to describe .
My wish to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work .
Could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me ? ?
"Is his a literature of defeat , irrelevant to the social crises we face ? ?"
Or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves ? ?
"That , I thought , is at least one thing I can find out when we meet ."
They look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel .
"His light blue eyes , set deep within the face , are actively and continually looking ."
"The voice is light in timbre , with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage ."
"The Irish accent is , as one would expect , combined with slight inflections from the French ."
The conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world-shattering .
"For one thing , the world that Beckett sees is already shattered ."
"His talk turns to what he calls `` the mess '' , or sometimes `` this buzzing confusion '' ."
What appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words .
We cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely aware of the confusion .
It is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in .
The only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess .
"One cannot speak anymore of being , one must speak only of the mess ."
Then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form .
"How , I asked , could chaos be admitted to chaos ? ?"
Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ? ?
If we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form .
`` What I am saying does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art .
"To find a form that accommodates the mess , that is the task of the artist now '' ."
"Yet , I responded , could not similar things be said about the art of the past ? ?"
"`` Not this '' , he said , and gestured toward the Madeleine ."
"There is the unexplainable , and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer '' ."
I asked about the battle between life and death in his plays .
"If life and death did not both present themselves to us , there would be no inscrutability ."
It is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes inexplicable .
"Two thieves are crucified with Christ , one saved and the other damned ."
The destiny of Racine's Phedre is sealed from the beginning : she will proceed into the dark .
The question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary -- total salvation .
But where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable .
He knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel .
"The family was Protestant , but for me it was only irksome and I let it go ."
My brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died .
At the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old school tie .
One day the dogs of Ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pigs '' .
But do the plays deal with the same facets of experience religion must also deal with ? ?
At a party an English intellectual -- so-called -- asked me why I write always about distress .
"I told him no , that I had had a very happy childhood ."
I left the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi .
It is screaming at you even in the taxis of London '' .
The personal quality of Samuel Beckett is similar to qualities I had found in the plays .
"At the same time , he is plainly sympathetic , clearly friendly ."
"If there were only the mess , all would be clear ; ;"
"As a writer on the theater , I have paid close attention to the plays ."
`` Waiting For Godot '' sells even better in America than in France .
America is now joining Europe in this `` mature '' phase of development .
"The creative urge , for example , transcends the body and the self ."
The dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression of ungratified sexual desire .
"For this reason , too , their language is more forthright and earthy ."
The beatniks crave a sexual experience in which their whole being participates .
They withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy the precepts of legalized propriety .
"If they avoid the use of the pungent , outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo ; ;"
"This is far from the vulgar , leering sexuality of the middle-class square in heat '' ."
Jazz is good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided sexual effect .
"Jazz is the musical language of sex , the vocabulary of the orgasm ; ;"
"Thus jazz is transmuted into something holy , the sacred road to integration of being ."
It is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative impulse in unfettered man .
"The mystique of sex , combined with marijuana and jazz , is intended to provide a design for living ."
That is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the title of the holy barbarians ; ;
"The mind has betrayed them , reason is the foe of life ; ;"
"Their work mirrors the mentality of the psychopath , rootless and irresponsible ."
Their rebellion against authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt characteristic of the juvenile delinquent .
"It is sex that obsesses them , sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed ."
What they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can inspire the Muse .
"If it is an honest feeling , then why should she not yield to it ? ?"
"`` Most often '' , she says , `` it's the monogamous relationship that is dishonest '' ."
This girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist who disapproves of her life .
She finds married life stifling and every prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous .
some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and lose contact with reality .
The new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must move toward simplicity .
"They embrace independent poverty , usually with a `` shack-up '' partner who will help support them ."
"Their previous legalized marriages do not count , for they hold the laws of the state null and void ."
What obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk ? ?
"Sex as the creative principle of the universe , the secret of primitive religion , the life of myth ."
Those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks .
"Since the homosexuals widely use marijuana , they do not have to be initiated ."
"The magic circle is , in fact , a symbol of and preparation for the metaphysical orgasm '' ."
front fences were covered with Virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle .
Square corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of cast-iron foliage ; ;
"they were topped by steeples complete in every detail : high-pitched roof , pinnacle , and narrow gable ."
On these posts the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang .
"One looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking wave of flower ."
the tricks that time plays with memory and memory with time are queerest of all .
In a stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water ; ;
"My great-grandmother , I have been told , made her garden her great pride ; ;"
Other flowers we might gather as we pleased : myrtle and white violets from beneath the lilacs ; ;
"the lilacs themselves , that bloomed so prodigally but for the most part beyond our reach ; ;"
"hollyhock blossoms that , turned upside down , make pink-petticoated ladies ; ;"
"and the little , dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere ."
Pale yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite ; ;
seed-pods of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch ; ;
red-and-yellow columbines whose round-tipped spurs were picked off and eaten for the honey in them ; ;
morning-glory buds which could be so grasped and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag ; ;
bright flowers from the trumpet vine that made `` gloves '' on the ends of ten waggling fingers .
We showed them to each other and said `` Would you have guessed '' ? ?
"Thus shielded , we played many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness ; ;"
We enjoyed a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school .
"In the heat of the summer , the garden solitudes were ours alone ; ;"
our elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch .
"We were not , however , entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street ."
"Every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell away again , crushed beneath it ."
"A wheel squeaked on a hub , was still , and squeaked again ."
"When the hay wagon had gone , and an interval passed , a huckster's cart might turn the corner ."
The lazy sing-song was spaced in time like the drone of a bumble-bee .
It became so monotonous as to seem a part of the quietness .
"the trees' shadows circled from street to sidewalk , from sidewalk to lawn ."
"At four-o'clock , or four-thirty , the coming of the newsboy marked the end of the day ; ;"
The streets of any county town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer ; ;
The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as well .
His appearance as Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience ; ;
"It is this modulation which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and , simultaneously , his wife's infidelity ."
By the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience ; ;
"beyond itself , also , it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's work ."
"The release , the freedom , involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible ; ;"
This prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art ; ;
"it is particularly the artist ( Tonio Kroger , Aschenbach , Leverkuhn ) who suffers from it ."
We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates .
"only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give ."
"As the first sentence suggests , both roads belong to death in the end ."
"He is a widower , his three children are dead , he has no one left on earth ; ;"
"also he is a drunk , and has lost his job on that account ."
This strange person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path rather than the highroad .
"`` Life '' points out that `` everybody uses this path '' , and starts to ride on ."
"Then an ambulance comes along , and they drive Praisegod Piepsam away ."
"This is simple enough , but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant ."
"The season , between spring and summer , belongs to life in its carefree aspect ."
"another wagon has no dog , and therefore is `` devoid of interest '' ."
"His religiousness is intimately , or dialectically , connected with his sinfulness ; ;"
His unsuccessful strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings ; ;
`` He made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth '' .
He is `` a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard '' .
We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism .
The word `` mimesis '' ( `` imitation '' ) is usually associated with Plato and Aristotle .
Here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent .
"Artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the involvement of all persons , however humble , in a divine drama ."
He is the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasped .
"The images themselves , like their counterparts in experience , are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately ; ;"
they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one another .
"They bring an inextricable component of value within themselves , with attractions and repulsions native to their own quality ."
Mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional sense .
A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy .
The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials .
"In contrast to all this , primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers ."
The principal defender of this view of primary experience as `` causal efficacy '' is Alfred North Whitehead .
We feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening .
Whitehead is here questioning David Hume's understanding of the nature of experience ; ;
A chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is one of derivation from the past .
It really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by Booker T. Washington had been going on .
For over a hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them .
"It's infuriating , this feeling that one is being picked on , continually , constantly ."
"By what right of superior virtue , Southerners ask , do the people of the North do this ? ?"
The cliche loses its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history .
The Declaration of Independence says that `` governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed '' .
The phrase `` consent of the governed '' needs a hard look .
Calhoun dealt with this question in his `` Disquisition On Government '' .
Who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community ? ?
That the Court order does not unequally affect the Southern region ? ?
He seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere .
I murmured something about a possible difference between New Mexico's history and Mississippi's .
"One can meet with aloofness almost anywhere : the THIDIU viewpoint , It Doesn't Affect Us ! !"
Southern Liberals ( there are a good many ) -- especially if they're rich -- often exhibit blithe insouciance .
"If there's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there's always New England ."
"New England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces , South as well as West ."
I'm talking about the grand manner of the Liberal -- North and South -- who is not affected personally .
If these people were denied a voice ( do they have a moral right to a voice ? ?
There is a legend ( Hawthorne records it in his `` English Notebooks '' .
"Whether historically a fact or not , the legend has a certain symbolic value ."
It is something which most of us try to get out from under .
It is a question which New Englanders long ago put out of their minds .
"It is the abstractionism , the unrealism , of the pure idealist ."
Our Northern brethren also I believe felt a little tender under those censures ; ;
"New England , as everyone knows , has long been schoolmaster to the Nation ."
"The state universities of Maine , New Hampshire , And Vermont are older and more `` respectable '' ; ;"
He was referring not only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory schools .
"I don't propose to go into their history , but I have one or two surmises ."
"In the early days of a homogeneous population , the public school was quite satisfactory ."
Among the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of English .
The family estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake Vattern in south central Sweden .
"It is a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic associations ."
He liked to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part .
"He gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , `` The Happy Artists '' ."

"In this final line , we have the key to his nature ."
"In a bold , sometimes careless , form there is nothing academic ; ;"
"all is seen and felt and experienced , the observation is sharp and the imagination lively ."
"he tells stories of the Thousand and One Nights , and conjures up before us the bazaars of Damascus ."
"The supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled , says the wife , her husband has achieved immortality ."
"To get it out into the daylight's glow Is my life's aim both first and last , the whole ."
"That little spark is all the wealth I know , That little spark is my life's misery '' ."
He is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been leading .
What he really wants is to find `` a sacred cause '' to which he can honestly devote himself .
"He did not , however , settle back into acquiescence with things as they were ."
Like his friend and contemporary August Strindberg he had little patience with collective mediocrity .
Strindberg's remedy for this condition was to tear down the old structures and build anew from the ground up .
"Heidenstam's conception , on the contrary , was to revive the present by the memories of the past ."
"Whether in prose or poetry , all of Heidenstam's later work was concerned with Sweden ."
In scope and power it can only be compared to Tolstoy's War And Peace .
"Hence the title of the book , referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king ; ;"
"His peculiar gift , as had been suggested before , is his intensity ."
"The Charles Men has a tremendous range of characters , of common folk even more than of major figures ."
"His ideal was Alexander of Macedon , as Napoleon's was Julius Caesar ."
Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him .
Then more than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness .
"As he had longed to be , he became the echo of a saga ."
Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory .
"Admirably written , it is a perfect introduction to Swedish history for readers of other countries ."
"Some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural , as suited to the legendary background ."
It is from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective was recruited .
The mythological private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways .
"On the one hand , he does not work for a large agency , but is almost always self-employed ."
"As a free-lance investigator , the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client ."
"On the other hand , the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases ; ;"
no client would ever think of asking him to do such things .
"He is , first and foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society ."
"In this way , the private detective gets the best of two possible worlds ."
There is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement : Adam Smith was wrong .
"Driven from the marketplace by the course of history , our hero disguises himself as a private detective ."
The birth of the myth compensates for the death of the ideal .
"With the advent of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes , the development of the modern private detective begins ."
A brief list of the great detective's little idiosyncrasies would provide Dr. Freud with ample food for thought .
Holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and other refreshing stimulants ; ;
he is prone to semi-catatonic trances induced by the playing of the vioiln ; ;
"he is a recluse , an incredible egotist , a confirmed misogynist ."
Holmes rebels against the social conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds .
"On the face of it , it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official police routine ."
"Watson's insight is verified by the mysterious link between Holmes and his arch-opponent , Dr. Moriarty ."
"The two men resemble each other closely in their cunning , their egotism , their relentlessness ."
They are presumed to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace .
"Just as Holmes the eccentric stands behind Holmes the detective , so Holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both ."
The latter's real descendents were unable to take root in England ; ;
they fled from the Victorian parlor and made their way across the stormy Atlantic .
"Like Holmes , the American private eye rejects the social conventions of his time ."
"But unlike Holmes , he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt ."
"With Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe , alienation is represented on a purely physical plane ."
"More profound and more disturbing , however , is the moral isolation of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe ."
"In a society where everything is for sale , Marlowe is the only man who cannot be bought ."
"In the end , he gets his man , but no one seems to care ; ;"
"but when the bird is found at last , it turns out to be a fake ."
The latter are either too stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care .
"In either case , they do not appreciate the private detective's zeal ."
"Frequently enough , the police are themselves in league with the killer ; ;"
"But even when the police are honest , they do not trust the private eye ."
"He is , like Phillip Marlowe , too alienated to be reliable ."
It is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery story which creates this fatal dilemma .
"That society responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo , a potential criminal ."
"He must , in short , cease to be a detective and become a rebel ."
Dashiell Hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write mystery stories and turning to other pursuits .
"In order to save the mystery story , they have converted the private detective into an organization man ."
The first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer .
"By monitoring , we mean some system of control over the types of information sent from the various centers ."
"If the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question , it has served as an exclamation ."
"On this basis , certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for illustrative purposes ."
"Looking at the diagram , we see that Af connection lines come in to each member ."
"Thus the cocktail party would appear to be the ideal system , but there is one weakness ."
"Information beyond nearest neighbor is carried second- , third- , and fourth-hand as a distortable rumor ."
"They also furnish proof that , in modern war , message sending must be monitored ."
The need for monitoring became greater when radio was adopted for military signaling .
The monitoring is the highest and most restrictive of any organization in existence .
"No questions , statements , or explanations are permitted -- only commands ."
Commands go only from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank .
The same command is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to corporal .
All orders originate with the officer of highest rank and terminate with action of the men in the ranks .
"are few in number , briefly worded , all different in sound ; ;"
and are combinable into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be desired on a parade ground .
"In contrast to cocktail parties , military organizations , even in the field , are more formal ."
( C ) Decisions of a general kind are made by the central command .
"Since the difficulty of drawing the net is great , we will merely discuss it ."
"But , for practical purposes , we have people who can be considered as such ."
"Let me quote him even more fully , for his analysis is important to my theme ."
"Some fourteen or fifteen years ago , in an essay I called The Leader Follows -- Where ? ?"
And with Progressivism the Religion of Humanity was replacing what Gabriel called Christian supernaturalism .
"And the common man was developing mythic power , or charisma , on his own ."
French Egalitarianism had had only nominal influence in this country before the days of Popularism .
The first of which to find important place in our federal government was the graduated income tax under Wilson .
"The importance of Rousseau's twist has not always been clear to us , however ."
"And the ussr existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar ."
"And by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in this country was spiritually Marxist ."
We of the liberal-led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation .
"All of this , I know , is recent history familiar to you ."
Lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue .
"It has moved on various levels , it has been clamorous and confused ."
"Obviously there has been no agreement on what American conservatism is , or rather , what it should be ."
"For it was neglected , not to say nascent , when the struggle began ."
"Though , to be sure , we gave Kennedy no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment ."
"But before I try to diagnose it , I would offer other evidence ."
I will mention two volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year .
Its refrain was : `` let us return to the individualistic democracy of our forefathers for our salvation '' .
"The second specific comment was the report of Eisenhower's Commission on National Goals , titled Goals For Americans ."
Let's take a panoramic look back over the course we have come .
And the basic character of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic .
and almost the only `` cure '' is early detection and removal .
So an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation .
Have not our physical abilities already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now living ? ?
We must believe we have the ability to affect our own destinies : otherwise why try anything ? ?
So we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to the effect of each on man's major needs .
"Asked which institution most needs correction , I would say the corporation as it exists in America today ."
In his stead is a milquetoast version known as `` the corporation '' .
"But even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of America , foreigners can ; ;"
and our loss of `` prestige '' abroad is the direct result .
"If we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it ."
"Socialism , I grant , has a definite place in our society ."
"Some forms of capitalism do indeed work -- superb organizations , a credit to any society ."
Its pretense to operate in the public interest is little more than a sham .
Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; ;
and for this human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests .
"Corporations react violently to short-range stimuli , e.g. , quarterly and annual dividend reports ."
Leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop .
The right to leave legacies should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated .
"Strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship ."
Certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so .
Perhaps a list of some of the `` practices '' of my company will help here .
"During the last years of Woodrow Wilson's administration , a red scare developed in our country ."
Many Americans reacted irrationally to the challenge of Russia and turned to the repression of ideas by force .
This hysteria reached its height under the leadership of Senator Joseph McCarthy .
Demagogues of this sort found communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped notions .
"New ideas were dangerous and must be repressed , no matter how ."
"Those who would suppress dangerous thoughts , credit ideas with high potency ."
They seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new .
they are priceless even though they cannot be recorded on a ledger page ; ;
"they are the most valuable of commodities -- and the most salable , for their demand far exceeds supply ."
"That , however , may also bring the police , if the thinking does not meet with social approval ."
Merely having a mental image of some sort is not the all-important consideration .
"Of course , there must be clarity : a single distinct impression is more valuable than many fuzzy ones ."
He appealed to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities that justice might be done .
"Despite the clarity of his presentation , his idea was not of Einsteinian calibre ."
"Shakespeare's wit and wisdom , his profound insight into human nature , have stood the test of centuries ."
What of his treatment of the Jew in The Merchant Of Venice ? ?
"If any had escaped expulsion by hiding , they certainly would not frequent the market-place ."
"He could learn at second hand from books , but could not thus capture the real Jewish spirit ."
He took the story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone .
"It would have been unwise policy , for instance , to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty Scotchman ."
He tells of his `` Jewish heart '' -- not a Shylockian heart ; ;
"This would make anyone crafty and cruel , capable of fiendish revenge ."
Studying The Merchant Of Venice in high school and college has given many young people their notions about Jews .
"Thomas De Torquemada , Inquisitor-General of the Spanish Inquisition , put many persons to death ."
Let his bones and his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong ; ;
"Shakespeare's Shylock , too , is of dubious value in the modern world ."
"Ideas , in and of themselves , are not necessarily the greatest good ."
Will his words come to be treasured and quoted through the years ? ?
What of the efficiency of this natural instrument of free discussion ? ?
"That doctrine has been accepted by many , but has it produced good results ? ?"
"In the same vein , a certain short-story plot has been overworked ."
Is the world better for having this idea thrust upon it ? ?
Long ago they consigned the notions of Kyne and Dixon to the scrap heap .
"The stepmother , almost without exception , has been presented as a cruel ogress ."
Debate is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the stepchild a happier one .
Research into several cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one .
"But ideas , just for the sake of having them , are not enough ."
"Ideas need to be tested , and not merely by argument and debate ."
"Man , we are told , is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from bad ."
May we state with confidence that in such an exhibition a republic will find its greatest security ? ?
"We must not forget , to be sure , that free discussion and debate have produced beneficial results ."
Debate rid us of McCarthy but did not give us much that is positive .
"It did something to clear the ground , but it erected no striking new structure ; ;"
It forced us to fix the responsibility for the position in which all medical commentators had been placed .
"The press conference became a stage which betrayed the drift of his private thinking , rather than his convictions ."
In this case others should not have had to raise the doubts and fears .
The Presidency demands an incisive awareness of the larger implications of the death of any incumbent .
"Ironically enough , in this instance such personal virtues were a luxury ."
For the tone of the editorials which greeted Mr. Eisenhower's original announcement of his running had been strangely disquieting .
`` My doctors assure me that this increased percentage of risk is not great '' .
But it is also the climax to one of the absorbing chapters in our current political history .
In any other man this reassurance to the electorate would have caused us a profound moral shock .
"We knew that it was , as reassurance , the ironic fruit of a deeply moral nature ."
This does not mean that the decision to run for office should inevitably have been revoked .
"The making of distinctions , like the perception of the great distinctions made , is an inordinately difficult business ."
Rather it is rooted in a difference of response to the threat of social disintegration .
The division is not between those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change .
These ways are absolutely irreconcilable because they offer two different recipes for man's redemption from chaos .
For the answer cannot be derived from any socially cohesive element in the disrupting community .
An interregnum ensues in which not men but ideas compete for existence .
The first two types of change occur within the inward and immanent structure of the society .
"Thus in both types attention is focused on the community itself , and its phenomenological life ."
"Voegelin has analyzed this experience in the case of the stable , healthy community ."
It has lost its ground of being and floats in a mist of appearances .
"Indeed , it is probable that this point is reached the moment the third level of change begins ."
The reasons for this experience are rooted in the metaphysical characteristics of such a change .
"Of all forms of being , society , or community , has the greatest element of determinability ."
The ontological status of society thus is constituted by the psychological status of society's members .
"The content of that psychological status determines , ultimately , the content of civilization ."
"Those social , civilizational factors not rooted in the human spirit of the group , ultimately cease to exist ."
Civilization itself -- tradition -- falls out of existence when the human spirit itself becomes confused .
"He needs existential completion , he needs , that is , to move in the direction of completion ."
And the direction of that movement is determined by his perception of the truth about himself .
"An existentialist is a man who perceives himself only as `` esse '' , as existence without substance ."
A number of considerations suggest that this occurs early in the process .
If the existent form is to be retained new factors that reinforce it must be introduced into the situation .
"However , the crisis occurs precisely as a weakening of spiritual forces ."
"It would seem , therefore , that in a civilizational crisis man cannot save himself ."
The emergence of the crisis itself would seem to constitute a warranty for the victory of disorder .
And it would seem that history is a witness to this truth .
"These differences , in turn , derive from prior differences concerning the friendly or hostile character of change ."
anxiety and deep insecurity are the characteristic responses evoked by the crisis in tradition .
These responses are explicable in terms of characteristics inherent in the crisis .
The response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is vanishing .
Its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through the repression of disruptive forces .
To this end political authority is called upon to exercise its negative and coercive powers .
"Seemingly , order is perceived as a kind of subsistent entity now covered by adventitious accretions ."
The problem is to remove the accretions and thereby uncover the order that was always there .
"Such a response , of course , misses the point that in crisis order is going out of existence ."
"Despite the hopelessness of the response , it is explicable in terms of the crisis of tradition itself ."
Their great error is to mingle the responses typical of each of the three types of change .
"Since civilizational change is the most difficult to perceive and analyze , it seldom is given adequate attention ."
And the anxiety it generates is misinterpreted as anxiety over private interest and threatened social status .
But this truth is distorted by its extreme application : the assumption of the separate existence of tradition .
The reactionary misses the point that tradition exists ontologically only in the form of psychological-intellectual relations .
"Reactionary theories , for this reason , usually assume some form of organismic theory ."
In both cases the individual tends to be treated as an instrument of the organic reality .
It is a total situation that is defended : the `` good old days '' .
All of which brings up another problem in the use of psychoanalytic insight in a literary work .
"Is the Oedipus complex , the clinical syndrome , material for a tragedy ? ?"
It is a mistake to look upon the Oedipus of Oedipus Complex as a literary descendant of Oedipus Rex .
I am suggesting that a case-history approach to the Oedipus complex is a blind alley for a storyteller .
Which brings to mind another Lawrence story and some interesting comparisons in the treatment of the Oedipal theme .
`` The Rocking Horse Winner '' is also a story about a boy's love for his mother .
I am only singling out differences in treatment of a theme and the resultant effects .
It is the story of the hopeless love of a little boy for his cold and vain mother .
I had read the story many times without asking myself why it affected me or caring why it did .
How does the rocking exert its uncanny effect upon the reader ? ?
"The rocking is actually felt in the story , a terrible and ominous rhythm that prophesies the tragedy ."
The rocking has the ambiguous function of keeping the erotic undercurrent silent and making it present ; ;
he has lost confidence in his own eyes and in the validity of his own psychological insights .
I have argued that Oedipus of the Oedipus complex has a doubtful future as a tragic figure in literature .
But The Holy Sinner is not simply a retelling of old stories for an old man's entertainment .
He is born in secrecy after the death of his father and cast adrift soon after birth .
The infant is discovered by a fisherman who brings him home to rear him .
"Grigorss , at seventeen , learns his story and goes forth as a knight to uncover his origins ."
Grigorss goes off to do penance on a rock for seventeen years .
and used gradations of color value as well as sharply contrasting elementary colors .
"Helion did not realize it at the time , but it was true ."
"but Leger , Arp , Lipchitz and Alexander Calder , at the time , gave him their blessing ."
"I played on it my secret songs , unexplained , passionate and peaceful '' ."
The extreme limitations he sensed in all current abstract art made that seem to him increasingly arid and cold .
"`` Fear possessed me , and the certainty of war '' , he has related ."
"`` I truly smelled blood , death , heaps of corpses everywhere '' ."
"With those paintings of big constructions crashing down , he felt he could stop ."
"Its first apparition was a long , gloomy column of refugees riding in farm wagons , or pushing prams ."
A year later they were removed to a Stalag in the harbor of Stettin .
"`` It was then I knew that they were making war against Man , the individual within ! !"
In the prison camp's Black Market civilian clothes were quietly bought and forged papers were devised for him ; ;
Every morning contingents of prisoners would be sent out to labor in nearby factories .
To escape from a prison camp required a very special state of mind ; ;
"not only loathing of captivity , but a faith , a hope that is even stronger ."
"I left behind me brave men , whom captivity had robbed of all hope ."
Everything in the way of representation has already been done by the old masters '' .
One of the pictures was of a man with hat drawn over his face ceremoniously lighting a cigarette ; ;
"If he condemns the recent or the present , he condemns the past with no less force ."
Others writing on Faulkner have found the phrase `` traditional moralist '' either inadequate or misleading .
"Among them are Frederick J. Hoffman , William Van O'Connor , and Mrs. Olga Vickery ."
Faulkner's is not the mind of the apologist which Mr. O'Donnell implies that it is .
He has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed Southern .
"There is no necessity , I suppose , to assert that Mr. Faulkner is Southern ."
It would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly Southern pedigree than that of his family .
"And , after all , he has lived comfortably at both Oxford , Mississippi , and Charlottesville , Virginia ."
Faulkner's low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier Southern novels dealing with plantation life .
He can sacrifice himself for tomorrow and he can sacrifice tomorrow for himself .
The thing that is notable in all these discussions is the lack of ideological ardor .
You could also say that in these pamphlets is a relieving quality of maturity .
"Mr. Lyford gives voice to a temper that represents , we think , an achieved plateau of reflective thinking ."
The picture is the more treacherous when it misrepresents the facts of American life .
"In an ideological argument , the participants tend to thump the table ."
"The new spirit , so well illustrated by Mr. Lyford's work , is wholly free of this anxiety ."
It does not appear that we will be delivered from our situation by articles on The National Purpose .
These institutions which Mr. Lyford names `` agreeable autocracies '' -- where did they come from ? ?
"This life has its own currents and rhythms , its own multiple cycles and adaptations ."
How would Thomas Jefferson feel after reading Factories In The Field ? ?
"The reality of the situation , however , is described by Mr. Lyford : ``"
"Given the conceptual context within which ancient thought thrived , how could anyone have questioned this principle ? ?"
"The reasons for this are partly observational , partly philosophical , and reinforced by other aesthetic and cultural factors ."
The obvious natural fact to ancient thinkers was the diurnal rotation of the heavens .
Nor did a constellation's stars vary in brightness during the course of their nocturnal flights .
The conclusion -- the distances of the constellations did not vary and their paths were circular .
"Moreover , the sun's path over earth described a segment of a great circle ; ;"
this was clear from the contour of the shadow traced by a gnomon before and after noon .
"Earth , being at the center of the universe , would have the same shape as the latter ; ;"
"so , e.g. did Aristotle argue , although this may not be an observational reason in favor of circularity ."
The discoid shapes of sun and moon were also felt to indicate the shape of celestial things .
"Additional philosophical considerations , advanced notably by Aristotle , supported further the circularity principle ."
Because motion which begins and ends at discrete places would ( e.g. for Aristotle ) be incomplete .
"Circular motion , however , since it is eternal and perfectly continuous , lacks termini ."
"Perfect , complete entities , if they move at all , do not move towards what they lack ."
"Thus , circular motion is itself one of the essential characteristics of completely perfect celestial existence ."
A candle alight in the air directs its flame and smoke upwards .
"It is covered ( partly ) with water , air is atop of that ."
The stars constitute an order of existence different from what we encounter on earth .
This is clear when one distinguishes the types of motion appropriate to both regions .
A projectile shot up from earth returns rectlinearly to its ' natural ' place of rest .
"But the natural condition for the heavenly bodies is neither rest , nor rectilinear motion ."
Being less encumbered by material embodiments they partake more of what is divine .
"No attempt is made by Ptolemy to weld into a single scheme ( a-la-Aristotle ) , these independent predicting-machines ."
They all have this in common : the earth is situated near the center of the deferent .
It is engendered by confounding the Aristotelian cosmology in The Almagest with the geocentric astronomy .
It is the chief merit in Copernicus' work that all his planetary calculations are interdependent .
He cannot describe eclipses without entertaining some form of a three-body problem .
"they are no longer a puzzling aspect of intricately variable , local planetary motions ."
"Another contrast stressed when discussing Ptolemaic vs. Copernican astronomy , turns on the idea of simplicity ."
It is often stated that Copernican astronomy is ' simpler ' than Ptolemaic .
Some even say that this is the reason for the ultimate acceptance of the former .
it involves a reduction in the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen '' .
But no single planetary problem ever required of Ptolemy more than six epicycles at one time .
"This , of course , results from the non-systematic , ' cellular ' character of Ptolemaic theory ."
These could be met only by considering the dynamical elements of several planets at one time .
This is more ambitious than Ptolemy is ever required to be when he faces his isolated problems .
"Thus , in no ordinary sense of ' simplicity ' is the Ptolemaic theory simpler than the Copernican ."
This was not simpler but much more difficult than exercises within Ptolemy's astronomy .
The number of primitive ideas in systematically-simple theories is reduced to a minimum .
"Copernicus , to an extent unachieved by Ptolemy , approximated to Euclid's vision ."
"But , considered within technical astronomy , a different pattern can be traced ."
That such deficiencies existed within Ptolemy's theory was not discovered de novo by Copernicus .
"Without abandoning too much , Copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy systematically and mechanically acceptable ."
He did not think himself to be firing the first shot of an intellectual revolution .
She was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done .
"In any case but the last , such a course is sure to avenge itself upon the individual ; ;"
"the moral powers no more than the physical and mental , can bear overstraining ."
"And , in the last case , a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding nature ."
"His father was a good friend of Rabbi Szold , and Joe lived with the Szolds for a while ."
"and the Szold family , as it developed , bore a striking resemblance to the Marches ."
"Mr. March , like Benjamin Szold , was a clergyman , although of an indeterminate denomination ; ;"
"Henrietta could easily identify herself with Jo March , although Jo was not the eldest sister ."
"When her right hand was incapacitated by the rheumatism , Sadie learned to write with her left hand ."
"She wrote gay plays about the girls for family entertainments , like `` Oh , What Fun ! !"
played Chopin in the `` Soiree Musicale of Mr. Guthrie's Pupils '' ; ;
"The Szolds , like the Marches , enjoyed and loved living together , even in troubled times ; ;"
No wonder Wright was enchanted -- no two better suited people ever met .
"Almost from that day , until his death , Olgivanna was to stay at his side ; ;"
"but the years that immediately followed were to be extraordinarily trying , both for Wright and his Montenegrin lady ."
"Even so , many of the things that happened to Wright and Olgivanna seem inordinately severe ."
"Flocks of writs , attachments , and unpleasant legal papers of every sort began to fly through the air ."
"Miriam now ordered Pengally to break down the gate , but he said he really couldn't go that far ."
"Then she rounded on Weston and cried , `` You always did Wright's dirty work ! !"
"When I take over Taliesin , the first thing I'll do is fire you '' ."
"`` Madame Noel , I think you had better go '' , said Mrs. Cupply ."
"`` And I think you had better leave '' , replied Miriam ."
"Turning to the reporters , she asked , `` Did you hear her ? ?"
The animosity expressed by such a scene had the penetrating quality of a natural force ; ;
"Under this kind of pressure , it is not surprising that Wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers ."
"`` This is a horrible way to live '' , Wright went on ."
"`` Take a gigantic knife and sweep it over the Loop '' , Wright said ."
If you cut down these horrible buildings you'll have no more traffic jams .
"After all , that's the job of the architect -- to give the world a little joy '' ."
A series of conferences with friends and bankers began about this time ; ;
how can he be financed so that he can find the work he ought to do ? ?
And now there was some question as to his continued residence there .
This might put Wright in such a bad light before a court that Miriam would be awarded Taliesin ; ;
"Miriam sniffed at this , and complained that Wright had said unkind things about her to reporters ."
"This exhausted Wright's patience , and in consequence he talked freely to reporters in a Madison hotel suite ."
"I realize , in taking this stand , just what it means to me and mine '' ."
"Next day , word came that Miriam was not going through with the divorce ; ;"
His mentioning of Japan and Holland had been merely the expression of wishful thinking .
"Besides , that particular message does no more than weakly echo the roar in all fresh blood ."
"Neither his appetites , his exacerbations , nor his despair were kin to yours ."
He might have been the man in the moon for all you could have understood him .
one can take it as no more than another veil torn from the mystery of the soul .
But it could also be looked at from the other end of the spectrum .
"if one bullies , they say it is because one is afraid ; ;"
"if one shuns , they say it is because one desires ; ;"
"and according to them , whatever one fancies one feels , what one feels in fact is the opposite ."
") , I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion ."
I had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid of self-betrayal .
But the time came when I was no longer innocent and therefore no longer helpless .
"To innocence , a word given is a word that will be kept ."
"Instinctively , innocence does unto others as it expects to be done by ."
"The innocence of which I speak is , I know , not incorruptible ."
I knew this knowledge to be corrupting at the time I acquired it ; ;
"You , I could swear to it , remained innocent in this sense until the end ."
The songs Sandburg sang often reminded listeners of songs of a kindred character they knew entirely or in fragments .
Often these listeners would refer Sandburg to persons who had similar ballads or ditties .
In due time Sandburg was a walking thesaurus of American folk music .
The second reason for his popularity is his complete spontaneity with the guitar .
"It is a mistake , however , to imagine that Sandburg uses the guitar as a prop ."
"He is no dextrous-fingered college boy but rather a dedicated , humble , and bashful apostle of this instrument ."
`` His fingers labor heavily on the strings and he asked for my help in disciplining them .
"There has long existed a brotherly affection between us , thus I accepted him as my pupil ."
One cause of Schopenhauer's pessimism was the fact that he failed to learn the guitar .
I am certain that Carl Sandburg will not fall into the same sad philosophy .
The public's identification of Carl Sandburg and the guitar is no happenstance .
"' Kalamazoo guitars ' , he said , ' used by radio hillbilly singers ."
"`` He chose one from Mr. Miller's window , a plain guitar with no fancy polish ."
He walked home at night for two miles beyond the end of a suburban trolley .
The impression you get from Carl Sandburg's home is one of laughter and happiness ; ;
and the laughter and the happiness are even more pronounced when no company is present .
"Through all these years , Mrs. Sandburg has pointedly avoided the limelight ."
"She has shared her husband's greatness , but only within the confines of their home ; ;"
Even now I will not intrude upon her except to state a few bare facts .
The only way to describe Paula Sandburg is to say she is beautiful in a Grecian sense .
"Her clothes , her hair , everything about her is both graceful and simple ."
"She has small , broad , capable hands and an enormous energy ."
"She is not only a trained mathematician and Classicist , but a good architect ."
"As the Sandburg goat herd increased , she also designed the barn alterations to accommodate them ."
"Her mother called her Paus'l , a Luxemburg endearment meaning `` pussycat '' ."
"Her parents , pious Roman Catholics , christened her Mary Anne Elizabeth Magdalene Steichen ."
"This family of Luxemburg immigrants , in fact , produced two exceptional children ."
"By the time Lilian had been graduated from public school , her parents were doing quite well ."
Her mother was a good manager and established a millinery business in Milwaukee .
But her father was not enthusiastic about sending young Paula to high school .
"`` This is no place for a young girl '' , he said ."
She knelt out of reverence for having read the Meditations of St. Augustine .
Paula was saddened about what was happening to little girls and vowed to kneel no more in Chapel .
`` I felt that I must devote myself to the ' outside ' world '' .
"`` And besides , Thorstein Veblen was one of the Chicago professors '' ."
"At the University of Chicago she studied Whitman and Shelley , and became a Socialist ."
She once gave a German recitation before a convention of German-language teachers in Milwaukee .
"He `` legitimized '' Paula for Lilian Steichen , and it was Paula who insisted on Carl for Charles ."
"She left the next day for her teaching job at Princeton , Illinois ."
") By the time the streetcar pulled away , he had fallen in love with Paula ."
we will not act in any way which would jeopardize our solemn commitments to them .
"We and our friends are , of course , concerned with self-defense ."
In recent years America's partners and friends in Western Europe and Japan have made great economic progress .
the intellectual honesty and capacity to recognize the true path of her own best interests .
We must meet this situation by promoting a rising volume of exports and world trade .
"Moreover , progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earned ; ;"
there is no easy and quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane .
"Respecting their need , one of the major focal points of our concern is the South-Asian region ."
Free world decisions in this matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom .
"Other countries , some of which I visited last month , have similar needs ."
A common meeting ground is desirable for those nations which are prepared to assist in the development effort .
During the past year I have discussed this matter with the leaders of several Western nations .
"The goal is to enlist all available economic resources in the industrialized Free World , especially private investment capital ."
"By extending this help , we hope to make possible the enthusiastic enrollment of these nations under freedom's banner ."
No more startling contrast to a system of sullen satellites could be imagined .
As a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives only from a position of broadly based strength .
This is less than the length of a jet runway -- well within the circle of destruction .
"From all reports so far received , its performance conformed to the high standards I have just described ."
The continuing modernization of these forces is a costly but necessary process .
It is scheduled to go forward at a rate which will steadily add to our strength .
These discoveries are of present interest chiefly to the scientific community ; ;
I am assured by experts that the thrust of our present missiles is fully adequate for defense requirements .
"Using launch systems presently available , we are developing satellites to scout the world's weather ; ;"
satellite relay stations to facilitate and extend communications over the globe ; ;
for navigation aids to give accurate bearings to ships and aircraft ; ;
and for perfecting instruments to collect and transmit the data we seek .
"Fifth , we have just completed a year's experience with our new space law ."
"Among current problems that require solutions , participated in by citizens as well as government , are :"
the need to protect the public interest in situations of prolonged labor-management stalemate ; ;
the persistent refusal to come to grips with a critical problem in one sector of American agriculture ; ;
"the continuing threat of inflation , together with the persisting tendency toward fiscal irresponsibility ; ;"
in certain instances the denial to some of our citizens of equal protection of the law .
"In the course of its inquiry , it took testimony from only seven witnesses ."
"It heard Bang-Jensen twice and his lawyer , Adolf A. Berle , Jr. , once ."
"Here , he openly attacked Bang-Jensen and referred to his `` aberrant conduct '' ."
"The four , bundled in overcoats , mounted to the wind-swept roof of the U.N."
In one of these he said were notes on the identities of the eighty-one refugees .
He knew it would be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence .
The Gross group had been formed for the express purpose of advising the Secretary General .
"Hammarskjold's supposed desire to seek outside legal advice in the guise of Ernest Gross is illusion , at best ."
"Gross's , being `` outside '' the U.N. applied only to a physical state , not an objective one ."
"`` Until this Hungarian Committee matter came up , Bang-Jensen was a fine and devoted individual ."
"`` Yes '' , Gross went on , `` Bang-Jensen was an up-and-coming young man ."
"Gross was behind a clean-top desk , only a manila folder before him ."
"Outside the office windows , twenty-four stories above Wall Street , a light rain was falling ."
"You know , Bang-Jensen characterized your Committee as having prejudged his case '' ."
"`` I think our report sums up our finding '' , Gross answered ."
`` What I'd like you to comment on is the criticism leveled at your Committee '' .
He claimed that the release of the preliminary findings was ' prejudicial to his position ' '' .
`` I thought the entire report was going to be confidential from beginning to end .
But you know Bang-Jensen launched an active campaign against us in the press .
"It was getting so that we , the Committee , were being tried ."
`` The reason for that report was to settle the matter of the list .
"As far as I'm concerned , it was a separate matter from the general Committee study of Bang-Jensen's conduct ."
`` How about your press conference three days later -- what was the reason for that ? ?
Bang-Jensen never explained what the documents or papers were that he had in his possession .
"`` It was foolish of him to keep them , whatever they were ."
"He could have been blackmailed , or his family might have been threatened ."
"We attempted to conclude this , and did so by having the papers burned ."
Hammarskjold believes the U.N. is an organization that settles matters in a procedural way .
`` What did you think about Bang-Jensen's contention of errors and omissions in the Hungarian report '' ? ?
One was an article on the U.N. by Alice Widener from the Cincinnati Enquirer .
"He probably didn't mean to write it this way , or maybe he did ."
"There wasn't any ' violent argument ' between Bang-Jensen and Shann , as the Tribune puts it ."
`` The case was that Bang-Jensen came up to Shann claiming he had found further errors in the report .
' I've found errors and I want you to look them over .
"And after all this , Shann went over all that Bang-Jensen had brought up '' ."
"( Shann's own report , Peter Marshall reflected , describes the encounter as `` immoderate '' ."
"It was a good report , he did all he could to make it a good report ."
"Don't forget , I am an old member of the club , a former delegate ."
I think you are being unfair to take these things up now .
It appeals to those who were frustrated in the outcome of the Hungarian situation .
"Don't forget , the U.N. did no more than the United States did ."
It takes a great deal of sophisticated thought to get the impact of this fact '' .
"Ernest Gross replied the next day , putting the suspended diplomat's fears to rest ."
"Marshall pondered the reason for this , and pondered too the replacement of one member of the three-man group ."
"J. A. C. Robertson , after serving Gross one week , left for England ."
"The sickness was gone and , after all , the two young couples were on their honeymoon ."
"At last they concluded that the heavy , full feeling in their stomachs was due to lack of exercise ."
"A rope was found and , like children in school , the missionaries skipped for hours at a time ."
"Finally , tiring of so monotonous a form of exercise , they decided to dance instead ."
"The weather turned warmer and with it came better appetites , although Harriet was still a little off-color ."
She was more excited than frightened at the prospect of having her first child in a foreign land .
"As for Adoniram , she found him to be `` the kindest '' of husbands ."
As warmer temperatures were encountered Ann and Harriet were introduced to the pleasures of bathing daily in salt water .
"I can hardly think of this simple fare without exclaiming , oh , what a luxury ."
This was the Greek word most often translated as `` baptism '' .
John the Baptist used total immersion in the River Jordan for believers ; ;
What would happen if Adoniram `` changed horses in midstream '' ? ?
"Even Harriet could boldly write , `` I know not how it is ; ;"
Ann thrilled to the sight of a delicate butterfly and two strange tropical birds .
"Sometimes ships waited for days for such a man , but Captain Heard was lucky ."
"`` He looks as feminine as you can imagine '' , she decided ."
all day long the Caravan slowly made her way through the difficult passages .
"Alas , to Ann's consternation , his language while thus employed left much to be desired ."
"Slowly she moved up the Hooghli River , a mouth of the mighty Ganges , toward Calcutta ."
"Ann was entranced with the view , as were her husband and friends ."
Out came the journal and in it went Ann's own description of the scene :
"They are very small , and in the form of haystacks , without either chimney or windows ."
"They are situated in the midst of trees , which hang over them , and appear truly romantick ."
The pagodas we have passed are much larger than the houses '' .
"This is the most delightful trial I have ever had '' , she decided ."
"At last they saw Calcutta , largest city of Bengal and the Caravan's destination ."
Crowds flocked through the waterfront streets chattering loudly in their strange-sounding Bengali tongue .
"Though she did not then know its name , this strange new fruit was a banana ."
All Captain Gibault took back to Salem were a few items for the town's East India Museum .
The Burmese appeared to have little knowledge of British power or any idea of trade .
"Cruel Burmese governors could , on the slightest whim , take a man's life ."
"She describes , first , the imaginary reaction of a foreigner puzzled by this `` unseasonable exultation '' ; ;"
"On the other hand , Molesworth was naturally assailed in the Tory press ."
"Of all the Whig tracts written in support of the Succession , The Crisis is perhaps the most significant ."
Steele's main business here is to arouse public opinion to the immediate danger of a Stuart Restoration .
"Like Burnet , he deplores the indifference of the people in the face of the crisis ."
"Treasonable books striking at the Hanoverian Succession , he complains , are allowed to pass unnoticed ."
"Anne was furious , and Bolingbroke advised that the request be refused ."
Steele in this paper is indicating his sympathy for such a plan .
but there is much here also which bears directly on his personal quarrel with Swift .
"Though put in rather maudlin terms , Steele's defense of himself has a reasonable basis ."
The final section of this pamphlet is of special interest in a consideration of Steele's relations with Swift .
"Next , Steele turns his attention to the `` Courtier '' he is addressing ."
The last point was soon to be included in the `` seditious '' remarks used against him in Parliament .
"among whom , his Party have indeed more Friends than I could wish '' ."
"It is filled with the usual personal abuse of Steele , especially of his physical appearance ; ;"
Johnny Mercer practically grew up with the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears .
The lyricist's father was a lawyer who had branched out into real estate .
"His second wife , Lillian , was the mother of John H. Mercer ."
By the age of six young Johnny indicated that he had the call .
The disappearance caused his family to assign a full-time maid to keeping an eye on the boy .
"The mother inquired , `` Where's Johnny , and why did you leave him '' ? ?"
"The maid then told her , `` Because he fired me '' ."
Such speech differences made him acutely aware of the richness and expressivness of language .
It generally took well into the autumn for the firm to recover from the summer's help .
This rather detached attitude toward life's encumbrances has seemed to be the dominant trait in Mercer's personality ever since .
"But Mercer hung on , living , after a fashion , in a Greenwich Village fourth-flight walk-up ."
"he just happened not to need any actor at the moment , however ."
"The lyric , Mercer remembers , was tailored to fit the unusual melody ."
"After leaving Whiteman , Mercer joined the Benny Goodman band as a vocalist ."
"'' , and `` Too Marvelous For Words '' ( all with Richard Whiting ) ; ;"
"Speaking of his work with Johnny Mercer , Arlen says , `` Our working habits were strange ."
"While Johnny made himself comfortable on the couch , I'd play the tunes for him ."
"After I would finish playing the songs , he'd just go away without a comment ."
"`` I couldn't write with them in the same room with me , but I could with Harold ."
"Arlen , too , worked on other projects at the same time with old friend Ted Koehler ."
"there'll be no more worry '' , matching the spiritual feeling of the jot ."
It had a single porcelain stall and but one cabinet for the chairing of the bards .
It was here that the terror-stricken Dennis Moon played an unrehearsed role during the children's party .
Arthur Robinson traveled with the baseball clubs as staff correspondent for the American .
He had barely assumed his stance there when a fat fellow charged through the doorway .
"Without any regard for rest-room protocol , the hulking stranger almost knocked Herford off his pins ."
The unrelieved stranger eventually turned away from the place of his -- shall we dare say his Waterloo ? ?
Governor Alfred E. Smith was the official host at the children's party .
United States Senator Royal S. Copeland was wearing the robes of Santa Claus and a great white beard ; ;
I was in charge of the arrangements -- which were soon enough disarranged .
Even earlier than that he had resented the fact that I had been chosen to edit the club's Reporter .
Mr. Hearst's telegraphic code word for Victor Watson was `` fatboy '' .
The Hetman's physical aspects were not those of a savage rider of the steppes .
"Indeed , he looked more like a well-fleshed lay brother of the Hospice of St. Bernard ."
"He had worked in the newspaper business since he was nineteen years old , always for the Hearst service ."
"Whatever the Hetman's ambitions , his colleagues were kept ill at ease ."
"Runyon , for his part , had a contemptuous regard for Mr. Watson ."
"He supported his mother and his brother , who afterwards committed suicide ."
About the only time the Hetman seemed excited was when one of his own pet ideas was born .
"Some of the Hetman's `` ideas '' were dream-ridden , vaguely imparted , and at times preposterous ."
I worked for a day on this plainly ridiculous assignment and consulted several of my own well-informed sources .
Then I spent the next two days at the baseball park and at Jack Doyle's pool parlors .
"He was busy , he said , in having someone submit to a monkey-gland operation ."
I explained my state of mind to artist Winsor McCay and to `` Bugs '' Baer .
Mr. Baer obtained a supply of crepe hair and spirit-gum from an actor at the Friars .
"We fashioned beards , put them on , and reported to the Hetman at the city desk ."
Mr. McCay had on a sort of Emperor Maximilian beard and mustache .
"As for myself , I had on an enormous black `` muff '' ."
"This , together with a derby hat and horn-rim eyeglasses , gave me the appearance of a Russian nihilist ."
"`` We are ready for your next mysterious assignment '' , said Mr. Baer to the Hetman ."
"Mr. Watson did not have much humor in his make-up , but he managed a mirthless smile ."
Just then a reporter telephoned in from the Bronx to give the rewrite desk an account of a murder .
The Hetman told me to take the story over the phone and to write it .
"I thought it expedient to take off my derby , my glasses , and the beard ; ;"
Then he wrinkled his huge brow and went slowly out of the room .
"He exposed the bucket-shop racket with the able assistance of two excellent reporters , Nat Ferber and Carl Helm ."
That word was withheld when the need of it seemed the measure of his despair .
"that is , until I became an editor , hence , in his eyes , a rival ."
"The colonel grunted , then made a remark which might be construed in either of two ways ."
"The Hetman did have friends , but they were mostly outside the newspaper profession ."
"Sergeant Mike Donaldson , Congressional Medal of Honor soldier , was one of them ."
"I cannot remember Dr. Gregory's reply , if , indeed , he made one ."
"If she were not at home , Mama would see to it that a fresh white rose was there ."
He would bring her boxes of candy and other presents to coax a smile to her lips .
"Dresses were short in the days of Mrs. Coolidge , and Spanish shawls were thrown over them ."
Mrs. Coolidge spent more time in her bedroom among her doll collection .
Mama always felt that the collection symbolized Mrs. Coolidge's wish for a little girl .
An accompanying sympathetic letter explained that inside the envelope was a name for Mrs. Coolidge's first granddaughter .
"The Coolidges' life , after the death of their son , was quieter than ever ."
It was part of Little Jack's work to look after the dogs .
"That was Rob Roy , who posed with Mrs. Coolidge for the portrait by Howard Chandler Christy ."
I would like to straighten out a misconception about the dress Mrs. Coolidge is wearing in this painting .
It is not the same dress as the one on her manikin in the Smithsonian .
People think the dress in the picture was lengthened by an artist much later on .
"The dress in the painting is a bright red , with rhinestones forming a spray on the right side ."
"Mrs. Coolidge gave Mama this dress for me , and I wore it many times ."
then he would bark to let everyone know the coast was clear .
-- he called all meals supper -- after the butler had announced the meal .
Every First Family seems to have one couple upon whom it relies for true friendship .
The word was that this too was part of an economy move on his part .
"He had been a friend of the Hardings , and continued to be invited by the Coolidges ."
Mama said she was one of the prettiest ladies she had ever seen .
"The wool would become frazzled around the edges from blowing in the wind , and Mama would mend it ."
She would often go up on the roof to see the attendant take down the flag in the evening .
Mama had told her how Emmett's lungs had been affected when he was gassed in the war .
He was in and out of Mount Alto Hospital for veterans any number of times .
"When Mrs. Coolidge was in mourning , she did not wear black ."
Mama knew that she was out of mourning when she finally wore bright colors .
She opened the boxes with a tear in her eye and a sad smile on her face .
"One night , Mama came home practically in a state of shock ."
"Mama stooped down to fix the train , but there was no train there ! !"
"She reached and reached around the dress , but there was nothing there ."
"She looked up and saw that , without knowing it , Mrs. Coolidge was holding it aloft ."
"Mrs. Coolidge looked down , saw Mama's horrified expression and quickly let the whole thing fall to the floor ."
"Mama swirled the train in place , and not a step was lost ."
The Coolidges did not always live at the White House during the Presidency .
In the arena of power Jews have at one time or another been somebody's ally ; ;
And so on through the roles referred to in the previous paragraph .
"Granted , such `` functional '' images are subject to human error ; ;"
they are self-correcting in the sense that they are subject to disciplined procedures that check and recheck against error .
In accounting for realism or distortion two sets of factors can be usefully distinguished : current intelligence ; ;
General Grant may have been the victim of false information in the instance reported in this book ; ;
He may have entered the situation with predispositions that prepared him to act uncritically in the press of affairs .
"Predispositions , in turn , fall conveniently into two categories for purposes of analysis ."
But millions of human beings were exposed to Lueger's propaganda and record .
Modern psychiatric knowledge provides us with many keys to unlock the significance of behavior of the kind .
"Undoubtedly , however , the significance of the volume is greater than the foregoing paragraphs suggest ."
Speaking as a non-Jew I believe that its primary contribution is in the realm of future policy .
Comprehensive examination of any policy question calls for the performance of the intellectual tasks inseparable from any problem-solving method .
The tasks are briefly indicated by these questions : What are my goals in Gentile-Jewish relations ? ?
What factors condition the degree of realization at various times and places ? ?
It is beyond the province of this epilogue to cover policy questions of such depth and range .
"However , in the context of legal and civic policy , these controversies are less than novel ."
They involve similar uncertainties regarding the multiple identities of any number of non-Jewish groups .
claims are properly disposed of according to norms common to all parties .
but it is perennially restructured in situations where anchors are dragged or lost .
It is not difficult to anticipate circumstances in which negative tensions will cumulate ; ;
"for instance , imagine the situation if Israel ever joins an enemy coalition ."
During moments of intense crisis the responsibility of political leaders is overwhelming .
At such critical moments predispositions favorable to human dignity most obviously `` pay off '' .
We are learning how to do these things in some of the vast organized structures of modern society ; ;
A truism is that the time to prepare for the worst is when times are best .
Now an abiding difficulty of paragraphs like the foregoing is that they appear to preach ; ;
and in contemporary society we often complain of too much reaffirmation of the goodness of the good .
"Properly used , the present book is an excellent instrument of enlightenment ."
"The traditional method proceeds by the technique of free association , punctuated by interpretations proposed by the psychoanalytic interviewer ."
For this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is necessary ; ;
but involvement needs to be accompanied by a special frame of mind .
"self-discovery calls for an open , permissive , inquiring posture of self-observation ."
Two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time .
"The reader , observing this process , might ask `` why not be different '' ? ?"
And find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species .
"And this , I think , holds for values as well as life styles ."
"It forms the core of many , perhaps most , problems of psychotherapy ."
"Literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose , dedication , mission , significance ."
The notion of `` inspiration '' is somehow cognate to this feeling .
"The Aristotelian notion of catharsis , the purging of emotion , is a persistent and viable one ."
This is given some expression in Beardsley's notion of harmony and the resolution of indecision .
It is possible that the idea of enrichment of emotion is a fifth idea .
"But there is one in particular which , it seems to me , deserves special attention ."
The study of literature contributes to this control in a curious way .
The rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions may be a most valuable human experience .
Anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what I mean .
"Among other things it means perception , discrimination , sensitivity to subtle differences ."
There results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the contemporary .
"Of course , it goes without saying that no student of ideas can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene ."
"When we assert the value of such study , we find ourselves committed to an important assumption ."
Many will add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding .
"We need not , to be sure , expect to find such ideas in every piece of literature ."
Understanding a work of art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or embodies .
"Such an understanding , although it must seek to be sympathetic , is not a matter of intuition ."
"This is what was meant , above , by describing history as inferential ."
Finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at present widespread .
We may also recognize cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and even indirectly the scientists .
"The blue-eyed Watson decided that he would dislike living in New York , and the deal fell through ."
"Hearst disclaimed blame for this , but the conversation , according to Lane , ended on a tart note ."
Hearst took a brief respite to hurry home to New York to become a father .
"`` He has not acted in any way , and won't let anyone take it away from him ."
This was the very sort of legislation that Roosevelt himself had in mind .
Roosevelt and others considered him partly responsible for the murder of McKinley .
"He might get votes from his constituents , but he would never get a helping hand in Congress ."
He showed little interest in measures put forward by the regular Democrats .
"The average Democratic politician , especially in the country districts , is hungry for the spoils of office ."
"If anything , the conservative Democrats were more opposed to Hearst than the Republicans ."
It caused Henry Watterson to sound a blast in his Louisville Courier-Journal :
"More splenetic was Senator Edward Carmack of Tennessee , a Parker man ."
"`` The nomination of Hearst would compass the ruin of the party '' , Carmack said ."
If he's going to the St. Louis convention as a delegate we ought to know it .
Our state has been overrun with a gang of paid agents and retainers .
"Koenigsberg never did learn what Hearst wanted , for the latter shook hands and moved toward the door ."
He took the stack of mail and tossed it into the waste basket .
He laughed at a story that he planned to bolt the party if he was not nominated .
But I do not have to be bribed by office to be a Democrat .
"I intend to support the nominee of the party at St. Louis , whoever he may be '' ."
Trevelyan contributed considerable new knowledge of the issues connected with his subject .
Later research has shown this part of the legend of the Re Galantuomo to be false .
First The Life Of John Bright appeared and seven years later Lord Grey Of The Reform Bill .
"Of the two , The Life Of Bright is incomparably the better biography ."
The biography of Lord Grey is strictly speaking not a biography at all .
Research in the period of Grey and Bright led naturally to a more ambitious work .
Economic analysis was never Trevelyan's strong point and the England of the industrial transformation cries out for economic analysis .
"Its success is a tribute , above all , to Trevelyan's brilliance as a literary stylist ."
The History Of England has often been compared with Green's Short History .
"But as a stimulating , provocative interpretation of the broad sweep of English development it is incomparable ."
Trevelyan is militantly sure of the superiority of English institutions and character over those of other peoples .
His delightful picture of society and institutions is filled with warm detail that brings the period vividly to life .
"Yet as an evocation of time past , there are few such successful portraits in English historical literature ."
"The account of the battle is , next to his descriptions of Garibaldi's campaigns , Trevelyan's outstanding military narrative ."
Ramillies And The Union With Scotland has fewer high spots than Blenheim and much less of its dramatic unity .
"I stood on a table , surrounded by hundreds of expectant young faces ."
Questions came to me from all sides about my world citizenship activities .
"`` Listen please '' , I called to the students in French ."
"These principles , however , will not be served by violence in any form ."
"If they are right , they will prevail of and by themselves ."
"If one finger is raised against the authorities , all our moral power will vanish ."
Your self-control in this respect will be the only witness to your understanding of what I am saying .
"I marched up to the waiting officials , the students massed behind me ."
"`` No , I have no permission to enter Germany '' , I told him ."
"`` Alors , you may go no farther '' , he said imperiously ."
`` I must then be standing on the line between France and Germany '' .
"But there is no line between France and Germany , that is , no actual line ."
"`` But if there is no line , how can there be two countries ? ?"
"You have just given me permission to leave France , which I did ."
"And as you know , I have no permission to re-enter France once out ."
Then will you give me a visa to re-enter France '' ? ?
From the crowd were coming cries of `` He's right '' ! !
"Finally they went off to file their stories , after the photographers had taken pictures of my latest vigil ."
"The students crowded around asking questions , slapping me on the back , and generally being friendly ."
"`` But what will you do this evening , Mr. Davis '' ? ?"
"`` I don't know '' , I told him , `` except that I will be here '' ."
"`` I shall see about getting you a tent '' , he said ."
"That would be a great help , I told him , thanking him for his thoughtfulness ."
"A little later , the sports shop man returned with a small pup tent ."
I was delighted to make that personal contact in such trying and unusual circumstances .
"The wind from the Rhine was damp and chill , necessitating a fire for warmth ."
"Each evening the students appeared with the soup kettle and several petits pains , Esther usually being among them ."
It was a merry if somewhat soggy Christmas for me that year .
"In the mail were invitations to speak at the universities of Cologne , Heidelberg , and Baden-Baden ."
Twenty thousand world citizens at Stuttgart had signed a petition inviting me to visit their town .
"The special guard , however , was still posted on Kehl bridge ."
"No matter how large the fire , I couldn't seem to shake off the chill that day ."
"I've had a trying day and I just can't make it out again '' , I told them ."
"She entreated me to see a doctor , and when I refused , brought one out to see me ."
`` You have just enlisted for the ' Rhine Campaign ' '' .
"Esther jumped up , ran to him and gave him a little hug ."
"His hat was gone , the tears were streaming from his eyes ."
Seven battle flags and fourteen officers' swords were sent to Thomas' headquarters .
About noon they came up with the enemy two miles from Lovejoy's Station and deployed .
Before making the news public Sherman sent an officer with the note to Thomas .
In a short time the officer returned and Thomas followed on his heels .
The next day Sherman issued his orders ending the campaign and pulled his armies back to Atlanta .
The measure of combat efficiency in an indecisive campaign is a matter of personal choice .
"Whatever the military world thought , the political world approved it wholeheartedly ."
He felt that this campaign would be famous in the annals of war .
Next best to destroying an army is to deprive it of its freedom of action .
"But , so far as its territorial objectives were concerned , the campaign was successful ."
"Within the narrow frame of military tactics , too , the experts agree that the campaign was brilliant ."
There was a battle on an average of once every three weeks .
"Men were killed in their camps , at their meals and in their sleep ."
This system was dependent upon identical maps and Thomas supplied them from a mobile lithograph press .
Orders of the day began to specify the standard map for the movement .
To the Rebels it seemed as if Sherman carried tunnels and bridges in his pockets .
The whistle of Sherman's locomotives often drowned out the rattle of the skirmish fire .
"The fossilized , formalized , precedent-based thinking of the legendary military brain was not evident in Sherman's armies ."
Sherman could never be accused of sticking too long with the old .
"One of Sherman's most serious shortcomings , however , was his mistrust of his cavalry ."
He never saw that it was a complement to his infantry and not a substitute for it .
A horse needed twenty pounds of food a day but the infantryman got along with two pounds .
"Already debilitated by the Chattanooga starvation , the quality of Sherman's horseflesh ran downhill as the campaign progressed ."
"Well led , properly organized cavalry , in its complementary role to infantry , had four functions ."
"Second , it could screen its own infantry from the sight of the enemy ."
"Third , it could threaten at all times , and destroy when possible , the enemy communications ."
"A great part of the time , Thomas' infantry never knew the location of the enemy line ."
At such times Thomas wondered when and where a counterattack would strike him .
It was the hard way to fight a war but Thomas did it without making any disastrous mistakes .
Johnston believed that Sherman put his naked engineers into the swimming parties to locate the various fords .
Rank was becoming an explosive issue in all three of Sherman's armies .
Merited recommendations from army commanders were passed over in favor of political appointees from civil life .
Luckily both women knew my position and if anyone suffered in their opinion it was not I '' .
"But if you are able & care to come , you know how glad I shall be ."
The terrible blow of the New Year put an end to that project .
"O my genius , young and ripening , you would swear , -- when I wrote them ; ;"
"I want you to be grandfather to these orphaned poems , dear father-brother , now I am gone ; ;"
since my silence must have ended when I gave the purposed volume to you .
"If you don't think much of them , tell me the wholesome truth ."
"Thompson , of course , was persuaded not to take the `` terrible step '' ; ;"
Some of the poems express a mood of joy in a newly discovered love ; ;
others suggest its coming loss or describe the poet's feelings when he learns of a final separation .
"Whose absence dearer comfort is , by far , Than presences of other women are '' ! !"
"Of course , there were books about which nothing good could be said ."
Thence he pushed farther south than he had ever been before into Podolia and Nogay Tartary or the Yedisan .
Potemkin was directing this conflict on three fronts : in the Caucasus ; ;
"along the Danube and among the Carpathians , in alliance with the Emperor Joseph's armies ; ;"
"and in the misty marshlands and shallow coastal waters of Nogay Tartary and Taurida , including the Crimean peninsula ."
"Here the war would flame to its focus , and here Lewis Littlepage had come ."
During a sojourn of slightly more than three months Chamberlain Littlepage could see action on both elements .
"As his second in command The Prince had Marshal Repnin , one-time Ambassador to Poland ."
"Representing the Emperor were the Prince De Ligne , still as impetuous as a youth of twenty ; ;"
"From Milan came the young Chevalier De Litta , an officer in the service of Malta ."
Lewis had expected to report at once to Jones's and Nassau's naval command post .
Around the billiard tables were always at least a couple of dozen beribboned generals .
"Among the visitors arriving every now and then there were , of course , women ."
Usually Lewis would find at headquarters one or more of The Prince's various nieces .
"His gray hair was thin , his face beginning to attract a swarm of wrinkles ."
"Like all Russians he was an emotional man , and in him the emotions warred ."
But he was perpetually engaged in a battle to command his own temper .
in camp he knew it won you the affection of your men .
"Underneath , he remained one of the best-educated Russians of his day ."
"Potemkin -- as King Stanislas knew , and presently informed Littlepage -- looked on the Cossacks as geopolitical tools ."
Suvorov saw in these scimitar-wielding skirmishers not demographic units but military men of a high potential .
"broader leather belt round the waist , holding cartridges and light sabre ."
Suvorov played parent not just to his Cossacks but to all his troops .
It was probably at this period that Littlepage got his first good look at the ordinary Russian soldier .
"When their levies came shambling into camp , they were all elbows , hair , and beard ."
"`` He's got high blood pressure , too , and bum kidneys '' , the doctor said to me ."
"`` Transparent look , waxy skin -- could well be uremia '' ."
By this time word had got around that an American doctor was on the premises .
One fellow who had liver spots held out his hands to the great healer .
I might not make any money but I'd sure have patients '' .
"`` All you have to do , Ilka dear , is to phone on your arrival ."
"In the late afternoon Mando came back to fetch us , and we drove to the Acropolis ."
We stopped first at the amphitheater that lies at the foot of the height crowned by the Parthenon .
"I suppose the same emotion holds , if to a lesser degree , with any famous monument ."
"Uh huh , we think , looking at them , so that's the Parthenon ."
Probably every visitor has a favorite time for his first sight of it .
"We saw it frequently afterward , but our suggestion for the very first encounter is near sunset ."
All we wanted to do was to stand very quietly and look and look and look .
"Another beautiful building is the Propylaea , the entrance gate of the Acropolis ."
"For some happy reason Doric , Ionic , and Corinthian have always stuck in my mind ."
"Athenian society was split into two factions , the Philistines and the Artists ."
"This was the crassest kind of materialism and they , the Artists , would have no truck with it ."
"This is a public bathing beach , easily accessible by tramway from the center of Athens ."
"Bedtime is late , for the balmy evenings are delightful and everyone wants to linger under the stars ."
the atmosphere is that of an attractive private beach club at home .
We went there a couple of times to swim and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly .
"This agreeable state of affairs is explicable , I think , on two counts ."
"For a delightful drive out of Athens I should recommend Sounion , at the end of the Attic Peninsula ."
"Three beneficial hurdles to progress are the lack of water , electricity , and telephones ."
Norton and I dined one night in a sea-food restaurant in Piraeus right on the water's edge .
"To enter it , you go down five or six steps from the road ."
"This restaurant , too , had a cat , a dusty , thin little creature ."
"We met some charming Athenians , and among them our chauffeur Panyotis ranked high ."
"His English was limited , and the little he knew he found irritating ."
"A particularly galling phrase was `` O.K. , Panyotis , we have time at our disposal '' ."
"In proportion to the degradation of his moral worth , is the increase of his worth to them '' ."
"To attack Pike directly would gain Woodruff little , for as a penniless newcomer Pike had nothing to lose ."
"Pike's honor would now come under attack , but not by Woodruff himself ."
He said Pike had stolen mules from Harris during the Santa Fe expedition ; ;
"The charges caught Pike off balance , coming as they did from an unexpected quarter ."
Finally he learned through the grapevine that the culprit might be one James W. Robinson in Pope County .
And Pike never did find out if Robinson was really responsible for the `` Vale '' letter .
"Shortly after the `` Vale '' incident , a rift began to develop between William Woodruff and Governor Pope ."
"Woodruff had supported him all the way , both as a chief executive and as a man ."
"After all , Woodruff owned a competent printing plant and was the logical man for the job ."
"`` We think the governor treated us rather shabbily , to say the least of it ."
He got a good fat job and we congratulate him on his good luck .
We hope that he will execute it in a manner that will entitle him to credit '' .
It was at this point that Pike decided to capitalize on the bad feelings between the two men .
The eventual prize in this new battle was the public printing contract that Woodruff still held .
"For some reason , none of them were impressed with the territorial capital ."
The internationally known sportsman and traveler Friedrich Gerstacker was typical of its detractors in the mid-thirties .
"Pike enjoyed his new social position tremendously , and cultivated in himself those traits necessary to its preservation ."
A biographer called him `` the premature John the Baptist of New England Transcendentalism '' .
The historian Charles Francis Adams called him `` a crude and half-crazy thinker '' .
Nathaniel Morton stated he `` was deeply leavened with blasphemous and familistical opinions '' .
Gorton sometimes signed himself `` a professor of the mysteries of Christ '' .
"He worked as a `` clothier '' in London , but was greatly concerned with religion ."
His wife was in delicate health and nursing an infant with measles .
One can imagine that with her and Gorton there it was no place for anyone with weak nerves .
Then he became involved in a ruckus remarkably similar to the one in Plymouth .
While driving the cow back home the woman was assaulted by a servant maid of Gorton .
"The old woman complained to the deputy governor , who ordered the servant brought before the court ."
Gorton then moved to Providence and soon put the town in a turmoil .
He held that no group of colonists could set up or maintain a government without royal sanction .
"Since Rhode Island at that time did not have such sanction , his opinion was not popular ."
"It was not within the jurisdiction of anybody or anything , including Providence and Massachusetts ."
If Gorton wanted peace and quiet for his complicated meditations this is where he should have had it .
"Following the glorious lead of the heroes of Pawtuxet , they also submitted themselves to the protection of Massachusetts ."
The purchasers rejected the order in two letters written in vigorous terms .
"The next week , forty soldiers were sent to get the miscreants ."
"The latter tried to arbitrate through a delegation from Providence , which offer was declined by the invaders ."
"At Shawomet , women and children fled in terror across the Bay ."
"Gorton evidently still had plenty to learn about Massachusetts , but he was learning fast ."
"The prisoners agreed , provided they might speak after the sermon , which was permitted ."
Here was Gorton's chance to indulge in something at which he was supreme .
"The Boston elders were great at befuddling the opposition with torrents of ecclesiastical obscurities , but Gorton was better ."
Reverend Cotton preached to them about Demetrius and the shrines of Ephesus .
"At the trial which took place later , the Pomham matter was completely omitted ."
"Getting out again , seeing old friends , had given his spirits a lift ."
`` It was mighty good for the old man to get out again '' .
The next day he seemed to be in fairly good shape and still in excellent spirits .
"It began in the morning , and very quickly the hemorrhage was a massive one ."
"To give a patient the wrong type of blood , said the doctor , would likely kill him ."
"One had to find a donor , and usually very quickly , whose blood corresponded with the patient's ."
And then it took considerably longer to make preparations for giving transfusions .
by now it was perhaps two days or longer after Papa had begun hemorrhaging .
"`` Fred , your blood matches your father's , all right '' , Dr. Glenn said ."
`` But we aren't going to let you give him any '' .
Papa had left us about the same hour of the night that Ben had passed on .
`` Mr. Wolfe had been in declining health for many years and death was not unexpected '' .
Funeral services were held Thursday afternoon at four o'clock at the home .
All about him stood tombstones his own sensitive great hands had fashioned .
Frank had been given about half his legacy to use in a business venture before Papa's death ; ;
"Papa , I should emphasize , had been an invalid the last several years of his life ; ;"
He had left us a legacy far more valuable than houses and lands and stocks and bonds .
"In those years of lower property valuations and lower tax rates , that payment represented ownership of much property ."
He wanted to go back to Harvard for another year of playwriting .
I believe there are seventeen short plays by Tom now housed in the Houghton Library at Harvard ; ;
"It ran two nights , and though it was generally praised , there was considerable criticism of its length ."
"it was demonstrated , many critics would later point out , in the length of his novels ."
In this play there were so many characters and so much detail .
"He was always concerned with life , and he tried to picture it whole ; ;"
"He was a big man , and he wanted nothing little , squeezed ; ;"
In this play there were some thirty or more named characters and I don't know how many more unnamed .
On returning to New York he had a job for several weeks ; ;
"But they would reconsider it , they assured him , if he would rewrite it ."
"Tom told me about it , how one evening he went over to see the Theatre Guild man ."
"Tom said he almost burst into tears , he was so disappointed and put out ."
"The public , Tom said the man told him , wanted realism , and his play wasn't that ."
Tom was not willing to revise the play according to the plan the man suggested .
Once or twice my father asked me if I wasn't overdoing a bit in my churchgoing .
At least I had been unable to lay hold on the experience of conversion .
"Try as I might to confess my sins and accept salvation , no answer came to me from heaven ."
"I was familiar with Pilgrim's Progress , which I read as literature ."
In the rhyming catechism this doctrine is worded thus : `` In Adam's fall We sin-ned all '' .
Some of these thoughts -- not all of them -- have taken organized form in later years .
The actual impelling force which severed me from evangelical effort was of another sort .
I became disgusted at being so preoccupied with the state of my own miserable soul .
They have remained on the opened page of my mind in all the years which since have passed .
"I do not claim to be free from sin , or from the need for repentance and forgiveness ."
As we observe moral law and physical law they appear as being inevitable .
They are not true because scientists or prophets say they are true .
"With this conviction , the partition between the sacred and the secular disappears ."
"His Ethics defines `` possessions as the property of the community , of which the individual is sovereign steward ."
another by giving away his property in order to help his fellow man .
On the contrary it is my duty to make my own decision as between the two '' .
"This viewpoint I find interesting , but it has never weighed on my soul ."
"To obey the moral law is just ordinary common sense , applied to a neglected field ."
This truth that the moral law is natural has other important corollaries .
One of them is that it gives meaning and purpose to life .
These lives are in themselves outside of the moral order and are unburdened with moral responsibility .
Respect for personality is a privilege and a duty for us as brothers .
"Then I asked , `` What does that teach you '' ? ?"
"In the face of the unfolding universe , our ultimate attitude is that of wonder ."
"One such is Abraham Meyer , the writer of a recent book , Speaking Of Man ."
This is a straightforward denial of the spiritual world and a vigorous defense of pure materialism .
Dr. Johnson and William Hazlitt of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in England ; ;
and James Russell Lowell and Edgar Allan Poe of nineteenth century American letters .
"While Aristotle censors literature only for the young , Plato would banish all poets from his ideal state ."
"When he discusses the subject matter of poetry , he asks what moral effect the scenes will have ."
Only those story tellers will remain who can `` imitate the style of the virtuous '' .
"Plato is , at times , just as suspicious of the poets themselves as he is of their work ."
"True reality , of course , is the ideal , and the poet knows nothing of this ; ;"
"And with this point about the passions , we encounter Plato's dualism ."
"Plato feels that man has two competing aspects , his rational faculty and his irrational ."
"and poetry , with all its emphasis on the passions , encourages the audience to give way to emotion ."
He even calls upon the poets to defend the Muse and to show that poetry may contribute to virtue .
"For this reason , he would banish indecent pictures and speeches from the stage ; ;"
"Aristotle's method in the Poetics , then , does suggest that we should isolate the work ."
"For one thing , Aristotle mentions that plays may corrupt the audience ."
He rejects certain plots because they do not contribute to that end .
"If Krutch is correct , tragedy may have quite the opposite effect ."
It may allay our passions and so restore the rule of reason .
No one suggested that the ethical effects of the art were irrelevant .
"He does not really approve of levity and laughter , but sex is the deadly sin ."
But it would not be very satisfactory to leave our conclusions at the point just reached .
hence changes in attitudes and values can be analyzed for identical individuals at two points in time .
It is not our impression that these evaluations are naively uncritical resultants of blissful ignorance ; ;
"rather , the generality of these students find their university experience congenial to their own sense of values ."
"Other conceivable goals , such as character-education and social adjustment , are of secondary importance to them ."
The ideal of a liberal education impresses itself upon the students more and more as they move through college .
There is a clear relationship between their educational evaluations and their basic pattern of general values .
We find `` reluctant recruits '' whose values are not in line with their expected occupation's characteristics .
many a people-oriented student who dreams of the M.D. decides to enter his father's advertising agency ; ;
`` Conservatism '' and `` traditionalism '' seem implied by what has just been said .
"Furthermore , in certain respects , there are norms common to colleges and universities across the country ."
"In the field of religious beliefs and values , the college students seem to faithfully reflect the surrounding culture ."
"Their commitments are , for the most part , couched in a familiar idiom ."
Students testify to a felt need for a religious faith or ultimate personal philosophy .
Avowed atheists or freethinkers are so rare as to be a curiosity .
"These personal and social goals often overshadow the goals of intellectual clarity , and spiritual transcendence ."
Our first impression of the data was that the students were surprisingly orthodox and religiously involved .
"after all , feelings of immortality and invulnerability are standard illusions of youth ."
Nor are optimistic and socially-oriented themes at all rare in the distinctive religious history of this country .
"Even on his tough constitution , the exposure and strenuous activity were beginning to tell in earnest ."
Nathanael Greene told Washington that `` Lafayette was charmed with the spirited behavior of the militia and riflemen '' .
A few days later it was learned that General Howe was planning an attack upon the American camp .
"Here the Pennsylvania militia skirmished with the British , but soon fled ."
Morgan immediately disposed his troops for action and found he had not long to wait .
"In his dealings with offenders , however , Morgan was typically firm but just ."
Daniel Morgan's rheumatic condition worsened with the increase of the cold and damp weather .
"In his absence , the rifle regiment was under the command of Major Thomas Posey , another able Virginian ."
The dreary camp at Valley Forge was turned into an arena of rejoicing .
Even the dignified Washington indulged in a game of wickets with some children .
"The Frenchman had been ordered to approach the enemy's lines , harass them and get intelligence of their movements ."
"Meantime , however , this same General Smallwood seemed to be serving chivalry as well as the American army ."
But Morgan evidently reported matters of intelligence much more important to his commanding general .
It is hard not to lay most of the blame for their failures on the pope .
Do you want to drive the king of England from all his overseas possessions '' ? ?
Alfred wanted to invest in my father's hotel and advance enough money to build a larger place .
In spite of his being well liked there were a few people who were very careful about Alfred .
"One of the people who was afraid of Alfred was his own brother , Lew ."
"Everything was all very friendly , except when it came to Harry , the youngest brother ."
The six miles between the towns became an ocean and the Alperts became a family of strangers .
Instead she waited for Alfred to get better and take care of her .
Spring was life -- and Alfred Alpert in his sickroom was death .
"My father , who liked Alfred very much , was a constant visitor ."
One day Alfred told him that he had decided to leave everything to me .
"if he wanted to leave me something let it be a trinket , nothing else ."
"He didn't want Alfred to leave me trouble because that's all it would be , and Alfred understood ."
The day Alfred left his home and Fleischmanns he gave up the convictions of a lifetime .
"He sent me for Meltzer the Butcher , whom he wanted not as a friend but as a rabbi ."
Solemnly he walked me back to Alfred's house without a word passing between us .
"He entered the house in silence , walked into Alfred's room , and closed the door behind him ."
"Then Meltzer's voice , quiet , calm , strong , started the Kaddish , the prayer for the dead ."
"Meltzer stayed with Alfred , and when the door opened they both came out ."
"Alfred , leaning on Meltzer , stopped for a minute to look at Tessie ."
"Outside , his brother Harry was waiting for him -- he had come to say good-bye ."
Alfred walked past him without a word and got into the car .
"The car began to move and Harry ran after it crying , `` Alfred ! !"
Harry followed the car until it reached the main road and turned towards Kingston .
I went to visit Alfred in the Kingston Hospital a few times .
The jug stayed at the hospital and the water -- what can happen to water ? ?
He came to Fleischmanns directly from the boat that brought him to America from Russia .
"He knew the whyfores and the wherefores but he was weak , very weak , on the therefores ."
"So Meltzer learned a new trade from Banks , who supplied the town and the hotels with meat ."
"Banks had a family -- a wife , a daughter , and a son ."
perhaps he was a little more sympathetic to the sides of beef that hung silently from his hooks .
And Lilly's whole family seemed to be an apology for Mr. Banks .
For every rude word of Mr. Banks's the family had five in apology .
I was free but she was bound to her duties that not even the coming of Meltzer lightened .
"When these chores were finished , only then , was she allowed whatever freedom she could find ."
"To me it was a game , to her it was the deadly seriousness of life ."
I wanted to help so that we could find time to play .
And Lilly allowed me to help so that she could have her few little hours of escape .
The road past the butcher shop took us along the side of a stream .
childishness compared to her grown-up understanding that life was a punishment for as yet undisclosed sins .
When we went for our walks Lilly's brother would come along every once in a while .
"Later , when I was older , I found the song was part of Schubert's Die Schone Mullerin ."
The value of place-names in the reconstruction of early English history had long been recognized .
"Place-names , in fact , had been extensively utilized for this purpose from the time of Camden onwards ."
Even before the century was out the tide of reaction had set in .
"Early in the present century , W. H. Stevenson continued the attack with a savage article against Guest ."
'' It is also worthy of note that Lot cited both Kemble and Lappenberg with favor in that article .
"Nevertheless , in another way modern historians still labor in the vineyard of the Oxford school ."
For it is their catastrophic concept of the Anglo-Saxon invasions rather than Kemble's gradualist approach which dominates the field .
Largely due to their efforts the catastrophic invasion-theory has maintained its position although Seebohm has always found supporters .
"Most scholars , while willing to accept a survival ( revival ? ?"
"Therefore , it is plain that the clear distinctions of the nineteenth century are no longer with us ."
"They , in effect , have compromised the opposing positions of the nineteenth century ."
"In recent years , however , a wind of change seems to be blowing through early English historical circles ."
We know that the Saxon Shore was a phenonenon of late Roman defensive policy ; ;
in other words its existence belongs to the period of Roman Britain .
"The problem , in other words , is strictly a chronological one ."
"namely , is the idea that there were Saxon mercenaries in England at all reasonable ? ?"
Baker gave Leonard Wood credit for the initiation of the draft of soldiers ; ;
"Baker took the plan to Wilson who said : `` Baker , this is plainly right on any ground ."
General Crowder proposed that Regular Army officers select the draftees in cities and towns throughout the nation ; ;
"Even so , the Draft Act encountered rough sledding in its progress through the Congress ."
Democratic Speaker Champ Clark saw little difference between a conscript and a convict .
"Democrat Stanley H. Dent , Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee , declined to introduce the bill ."
Democratic Floor Leader Claude Kitchin would have no part of the measure .
He was Julius Kahn for whom the Chief of Staff thought no honor could be too great .
In early June ten million young men registered by name and number .
The malady was popularly known as the `` Spanish flu '' from the alleged locale of its origin .
The world-wide total of deaths from `` Spanish flu '' was around twenty million ; ;
"Fosdick insisted that a strong word was needed from Washington , and it was immediately forthcoming ."
We no longer use the particular terms of Lessing and Victor Hugo .
The word `` tragedy '' encloses for us in a single span both the Greek and the Elizabethan example .
The intimations of a related spirit and ordering of human values are stronger than any sense of disparity .
Comparable visions of life are at work in Antigone and Romeo And Juliet .
The image of man which enters into force with Aeschylus is still vital in Phedre and Athalie .
It is the triumph of rationalism and secular metaphysics which marks the point of no return .
Shakespeare is closer to Sophocles than he is to Pope and Voltaire .
"In Greek tragedy as in Shakespeare , mortal actions are encompassed by forces which transcend man ."
"We cannot conceive of Oedipus without a Sphinx , nor of Hamlet without a Ghost ."
The shadows cast by the personages of Greek and Shakespearean drama lengthen into a greater darkness .
And the entirety of the natural world is party to the action .
Those who walk on it may encounter at any turn ministers of grace or damnation .
Oedipus and Lear instruct us how little of the world belongs to man .
Modern roosters have lost the art of crowing restless spirits back to Purgatory .
The wheel of social life spun around the royal or aristocratic centre .
"From it , spokes of order and degree led to the outward rim of the common man ."
"Its sphere is that of royal courts , dynastic quarrels , and vaulting ambitions ."
And the fate of such men has tragic relevance because it is public .
"Agamemnon , Creon , and Medea perform their tragic actions before the eyes of the polis ."
"Similarly the sufferings of Hamlet , Othello , or Phedre engage the fortunes of the state ."
"Hence the natural setting of tragedy is the palace gate , the public square , or the court chamber ."
Princes and factions clashed in the open street and died on the open scaffold .
The art of Defoe and Richardson is founded on an awareness of this great change .
"Behind the tragic hero stands the chorus , the crowd , or the observant courtier ."
It served also as a literary form exactly appropriate to the fragmented audience of modern urban culture .
Until the advent of rational empiricism the controlling habits of the western mind were symbolic and allegoric .
There had not yet supervened between understanding and expression the new languages of mathematics and scientific formulas .
"The poet was by definition a realist , his imaginings and parables being natural organizations of reality ."
"They are as decisively present in the Oresteia and Oedipus as in Macbeth , King Lear , and Phedre ."
And their chroniclers are not the dramatic poets but the prose novelists .
The wedding of the Hellenic to the northern genius was one of the dominant motifs in Goethe's thought .
The dream of a descent into the gardens of the south always drew German ambitions toward Rome and Sicily .
The motif of Faust's love for Helen of Troy goes back to the sources of the Faustian legend .
It tells us of the ancient human desire to see the highest wisdom joined to the highest sensual beauty .
It is thus that the brightness of Helen passes through Marlowe's Faustus .
Faust rescuing Helen from Menelaus' vengeance is the genius of renaissance Europe restoring to life the classic tradition .
Wherefore I thynke yow maye doo good yff yow can have money '' .
"William Parsons and William Walford , drapers , asked Quiney to see to business matters in London ."
He also sued them for taking toll of grain at their market .
"The corporation proposed Chief Justice Anderson for an arbiter , sending him a gift of sack and claret ."
They react in obedience to an instinct or urge which has itself been impelled by natural law .
Adams firmly contended that the historian must never underrate the impact of the geographical environment on history .
Brooks Adams was consistent in his admonishments to historians about the necessary tools or insights they needed to possess .
A similar amateurish characteristic is revealed in Adams' failure to check the accuracy and authenticity of his informational sources .
"If he found data that fitted his general plan , he used it and counted his sources trustworthy ."
"Conversely , if statistics were uncovered which contradicted a cherished theory , the sources were denounced as faulty ."
Such manipulations are frequently encountered in his essay on the suppression of the monasteries during the English reformation .
What is exposited by this observation is not the inherent prejudices of Englishmen but the Anglophobia of Brooks Adams .
In all fairness it must be admitted that Adams made no pretense at being an impartial historian .
Impartiality to him meant an unwillingness to generalize and to search for a synthesis .
Ranke and his disciples had reduced history to a profession of dullness ; ;
He wrote eloquently to William James that impartial history was not only impossible but undesirable .
"It was history that must be in error , not the historian ."
No page seems to be complete without the statement of at least one unproved generalization .
It made no difference that most evidence points to an opposite conclusion .
For Adams had made up his mind before all the facts were available .
All critics of Adams and his methods have observed this particular deficiency .
"Moreover , stated Day , `` He always omits facts which tend to disprove his hypothesis '' ."
Brooks Adams considered religion as an extremely significant manifestation of man's fear of the unknown .
he simply did not believe that a Creator intervened or interfered in human affairs .
The historian need not be concerned with the philosophical problems suggested by religion .
"Furthermore , he must regard religion as the expression of human forces ."
"Students of anthropology and comparative religion had long been aware that there was , indeed , a direct connection ."
"To keep themselves entrenched in power , the priests were forced to demonstrate their unique status through the miracle ."
It was the use of the supernatural that kept them in business .
The dark views about the Puritans found in The Emancipation Of Massachusetts were never altered .
"In fact , he had raised quetzal birds in his camp in the forest of Ecuador ."
Victor's book on John Lloyd Stephens was largely written in my study in the house at Weston .
We found that a charitable society in New York had a long case-history of the two ; ;
and they agreed to see that the tragic pair would not put poison in anybody else's soup .
"He said , `` Some have criticized your book as being neither literary criticism nor history ."
"He replied , `` My first choice would be Mark Howe '' ."
This friend of many years came once to visit us in the house at Weston .
`` Did you ever know a man with greater zest for information ? ?
"And his memory , like an elephant's , stored with precise knowledge of men and things and happenings '' ."
"I should have replied , `` I probably know something about the best part of you '' ."
But I only thought of that in the middle of the night .
"`` But however we go , whatever our doom , it will not take the Orwellian shape '' ."
they merely do their best to make it real for others '' .
"They would go to New York together , where parties would be piled on weariness and on misery ."
"`` This whole Washington venture was my last gesture , and it has failed ."
Physically as well as mentally I have reached the limit of my endurance .
"And she withdrew then to Cromwell Hall , in Cromwell , Connecticut ."
Harcourt replied : `` I do really hope you can achieve serenity in the course of time .
"Of course I hope Hal can also , but those hopes are much more faint '' ."
He was of unsettled mind as to whether he should go abroad when the Gantry galleys were finished .
"When Breasted insisted that this was impossible for him , Lewis decided to go abroad ."
L. M. Birkhead challenged him to name one and he was silent .
"But that sermon , like those of hundreds of other ministers , was yet to be delivered ."
The New York Times editorialist wondered just who would stop Mr. Lewis and make him write a book .
These rumors of permanent separation started up a whole crop of stories about her .
"And she replied , `` I was born in America , but I was conceived in Vienna '' ."
"He invited Lady Sybil , Lord Thomson , Bechhofer Roberts , and a half dozen others ."
"He suggested that they call on these brothers , who received them pleasantly ."
"It was late , and Blackman was ready to go to sleep , but Lewis was not ."
"He said , `` We had a good time tonight , didn't we , Earl '' ? ?"
Then the various officers of the college might take up the case .
Of course the higher officials could add or place a name on the list wherever they wished .
Of course the principal factor in the whole experience was the kind of education he received .
"Above all , he had learned to write formal Latin prose and verse to a remarkable degree of artistry ."
"These were his public academic activities , domi forisque , in the college and in the university ."
"His statements about sports and exercises of a physical nature are suggestive , but inconclusive ."
Venn and others have dealt with sports and pastimes at Cambridge in Milton's day with not very specific results .
"The town itself and the `` reedy Cam '' he often visited , as did all in the university ."
"He was then a slightly built young man of pleasing appearance , medium stature , and handsome face ."
All western Europe would hear and listen to him in this same vein about the middle of the century .
"A man could travel anywhere he pleased , eat whatever he fancied -- without handing over any money '' ."
"soyaburgers have replaced meat , and wood has become so precious that it is saved for expensive jewelry ; ;"
and the atmosphere is so befouled that no one dares walk in the open without respirators or soot plugs .
"Thus we will have a society consisting of the planners or conditioners , and the controlled ."
"As Courtenay explains , `` Here in this profession we reach into the souls of men and women ."
And we do it by taking talent -- and redirecting it '' .
But the only ideal he can think of is `` Sales '' ! !
`` Young for his age '' means only the presence of some minor characteristic not quite usual .
`` Looking young for your age '' means `` for your age '' and it means no more .
A mind expressing itself in words may reveal itself a little less obviously as old or young .
Its surface loses its bloom and submits to its wrinkles in ways less immediately obvious than the body does .
"Youth may be , and often is , skeptical , cynical or despairing ; ;"
"age may be idealistic , believing and much given to professions of optimism ."
But there are at least two reasons for contemplating one's mind in even a cracked mirror .
One is that there sometimes are real although inadequate compensations in growing old .
At least I should like them to know that I know these discounts are being made .
Let me then ( and in public ) glance into the mirror .
For my part I find it difficult to conceive such a state of affairs .
There are few things of which I am prouder than of that unblemished record .
"He asked me suddenly , `` What are your political opinions '' ? ?"
"After a moment's thought he replied , `` That still leaves you a lot of latitude '' ."
"I never have been , and am not now , any kind of utopian ."
It will probably explain more of my attitudes toward society than any other phrase or principle could .
But one need not always be sure that the action is either wise or conclusive .
"Apropos of what some would call cynicism , I remember an anecdote the source of which I forget ."
One day he was visited by a delegation of would-be imitators who wanted to know his secret .
"`` Why '' , he replied , `` it is perfectly simple ; ;"
All you have to do is put in a fresh lamb from time to time '' .
The promise that the lion and the lamb will lie down together was given in the future tense .
"namely , the law that prescribes the death penalty for murder when there seem to be no extenuating circumstances ."
It is not that I am unaware of the force of their strongest contention .
Seems to me to create a dilemma not to be satisfactorily disposed of by a simple negative answer .
`` Man engages only a small part of himself in an action '' says old Alvear the art-historian ; ;
"These biographical analogies are obvious , and far too much time has been spent speculating on their possible implications ."
and we must attend to it more closely than has usually been done .
they instinctively struggle to keep open a road to the future in their hearts .
This new vision of man that the narrator acquires is also accompanied by a re-vision of his previous view .
Is this not Malraux himself alluding to his own earlier infatuation with the ideological ? ?
"The human is deeper than a mass ideology , certainly deeper than the isolated individual ; ;"
As an Alsatian before the first World War he was of course of German nationality ; ;
Vincent Berger's mission is a failure because the Ottoman nationalism on which Enver Pasha counted does not exist .
Central Asia is sunk in a somnolence from which nothing can awaken it ; ;
"Trains whistling in the night , the rattle and clatter of cabs ."
"Despite Berger's report , Enver Pasha refuses to surrender his dream of a Turkish Blood Alliance ; ;"
and Vincent Berger learns that political ambition is more apt to hide than to reveal the truth about men .
Thus far the advances made have been almost entirely along functional lines .
Another powerful factor in the European movement was the threat of Soviet aggression .
"And of course the Soviet threat was responsible for NATO , the grand alliance of the Atlantic nations ."
New organs of unification proliferated in the decade following the conclusion of the NATO alliance .
The United States and Canada belong only to NATO and the new O.E.C.D. .
"The NATO Council is available as an executive agency , the Standing Group as a high military authority ."
The unofficial Conference of Parliamentarians is available as a potential legislative authority .
An equally promising avenue toward Atlantic community may lie through the development and expansion of the O.E.C.D. .
"And if we do not aspire to too much , it is also within our capacity ."
It is very much a matter of building the foundations of community .
A working concept of the organic evolution of community must lead us in a different direction .
the history of both the League of Nations and the United Nations demonstrates that .
"But a powerful sense of community , even with little or no machinery , means a great deal ."
Under the general heading `` poetry-and-jazz '' widely divergent experiments have been carried out .
( Judy Tristano now has poems as well as ballads written for her .
But the best known exploiters of the new medium are Kenneth Rexroth and Kenneth Patchen .
Rexroth and Patchen are far apart musically and poetically in their experiments .
) The stated goal of the CJS is the synthesis of jazz and `` serious '' music .
"From the beginning of his career , Patchen has adopted an anti-intellectual approach to poetry ."
Patchen believes that the world is being destroyed by power-hungry and money-hungry people .
"Beauty as well as love is redemptive , and Patchen preaches a kind of moral salvation ."
The Dark Kingdom sends Angels of Death and other fateful messengers down to us with stern tenderness .
Many of his poems purported to be exactly contemporary and political ; ;
"The private detective is militant against injustice , a humorous and ironic explorer of the underworld ; ;"
"most important to Patchen , he was a non-literary hero , and very contemporary ."
"he has become Friday on Dragnet , a mouthpiece of arbitrary police authority ."
"Obviously , the `` private eye '' can have no more appeal for Patchen ."
It was logical that he would come up with the figure of the modern jazz musician .
"In this respect , his approach to poetry-and-jazz is in marked contrast to Kenneth Rexroth's ."
It is difficult to draw the line between stereotype and the reality of the jazz musician .
"Seen by the public , the musician is the underdog par excellence ."
"He is forced to play for little money , and must often take another job to live ."
"While he is worldly , the musician often cultivates public attitudes of childlike astonishment and naivete ."
"he is far from being a literary hero , yet is a creative artist ."
This involves a shift in Patchen's attitude and it is a first step toward writing a new jazz poetry .
Henry Miller characterized Patchen as a `` man of anger and light '' .
The following passage from `` The Hangman's Great Hands '' illustrates the directness of this anger .
Angry that my father was being burnt alive in the mills ; ;
Angry because I was that very one somebody was supposed To be fighting for '' .
"'' Patchen is still the rebel , but he writes in a doleful , mournful tone ."
each is so typical that it represents a prominent trend in the poet's development .
"In many of his poems , death comes by train : a strongly evocative visual image ."
He spent one year at the University of North Carolina because Thomas Wolfe went there .
"But I've got news for Krim : he's not typical , he's pretty special ."
"In any case , who ever thought that New York is typical of anything ? ?"
"Men of Krim's age , aspirations , and level of sophistication were typically involved in politics before the war ."
"They did not `` duck the war '' but they fought in it , however reluctantly ; ;"
"They did not worry about `` experience '' , because experience thrust itself upon them ."
Only a native New Yorker could believe that New York is now or ever was a literary center .
Krim's typicality consists only in his New Yorker's view that New York is the world ; ;
Closely related to his illusions about his typicality is Krim's complicated feeling about his Jewishness .
"He writes , `` Most of my friends and I were Jewish ; ;"
"Krim says , in short , that he is a suffering Jew ."
"The only possible answer to that is , I am a suffering Franco-Irishman ."
"We all love to suffer , but some of us love to suffer more than others ."
Krim's main attack is upon the aesthetic and the publishing apparatus of American literary culture in our day .
Krim came to believe that `` the novel as a form had outlived its vital meaning '' .
Both magazines were `` rigid with reactionary what-will-T. S. Eliot-or-Martin Buber-think ? ?
"'' Kenyon , Sewanee , and Hudson operated in an `` Anglo-Protestant New Critical chill '' ; ;"
"Qui s'excuse s'accuse , as the French Jewish intellectuals used to say ."
"The most obvious characteristic of contemporary American writing , apart from the beat nonsense , is its cosmopolitanism ."
"Screwed , stewed , and tattooed , as Krim might say after reading a book about sailors ."
"The universities certainly were not doing it , nor were the popular magazines of the day ."
if it had never printed a word of literature its contribution to the politico-sociological area would still be historic .
"Partisan Review and the other literary magazines helped to educate , in the best sense , an entire generation ."
That these magazines also deluded the Krims of the world is unfortunate but inevitable .
"( there are no ) literary movements , `` there are only writers doing their work ."
"Literary movements are the '' , creation of pimps who live off writers ."
"He indicates that he has none of the , disciplines that criticism requires , including education ; ;"
"He wasn't being , `` educated in '' those Village bull-sessions , as he claims ."
"the '' , rest will turn beat , or into dentists , or into beat , dentists ."
The most appalling aspect of Krim's piece is his reflection of the beat aesthetic .
"Something was happening all right , slowly it is true , but you could feel it ."
"But , who knew , that might be coming one of these days ."
"There were other Italians who still bore scars they had earned in police station basements , resisting ."
On his desk was a slowly accumulating treatment and script of The Count Of Monte Cristo .
"Rimanelli is tough and square-built and adventurous , says what he thinks ."
"He had put it down in a war novel , The Day Of The Lion ."
The English lady said she had to go to Vienna for a while .
Once out of the gate they had charged straight up the narrow lane .
We were at a party once and heard an idealistic young European call that awful charge glorious .
"`` Oh , it would be butchery all right '' , the European said ."
"`` We would see it that way , but it was glorious then ."
It was the last time in history anybody could do something gloriously like that '' .
"They made it , killed every last one of the Krauts , took the village on schedule ."
"When it was over , eight of his company were still alive and all eight were wounded ."
"Like everything else in Rome , ruins and monuments alike , that house is lived in ."
"For one thing , there wasn't going to be any ceremony at all this year ."
") And then there were ecclesiastical matters , the matter of Garibaldi's anti-clericalism ."
There was a new Pope and the Vatican was making itself heard and felt these days .
"As it happens the English lady is a good Catholic herself , but of more liberal political persuasion ."
Nothing was going to be done this year to celebrate Garibaldi's bold and unsuccessful defense of Rome .
"This would show that somebody , even a foreigner living in Rome , cared ."
Some of the marble busts in the park are of young Englishmen who fought and died for Garibaldi .
She also mentioned leaving a little bunch of flowers at the bust of Lauro Di Bosis .
It is hard for me to know how I feel about Lauro Di Bosis .
"Most Romans , even some postmen , know it by the old name ."
"The things that happened in police station basements were dirty , grubby , and most often anonymous ."
"It is an ugly business and there are few , if any , wreaths for them ."
I keep thinking of a young woman I knew during the Occupation in Austria .
I understand very well about Lauro Di Bosis and how his action is symbolic .
The trouble is that like many symbols it doesn't seem a very realistic one .
"My spoon stirring coffee , banging against the side of the cup , sounded as loud as a bell ."
I hate embarrassing silences and have been known to make a fool out of myself just to prevent one .
"Like every Southerner I can't escape the romantic tradition of brave defeats , forlorn lost causes ."
Maybe I could call Rimanelli at the magazine Rottosei where he worked .
"It develops and analyzes the national income , balance of international payments , and many other business indicators ."
Practical management problems and their suggested solutions are dealt with in a series of SBA publications .
Production specialists in SBA regional offices are available to help individual small business concerns with technical production problems .
Guidance and advice are available on new product research and development ; ;
"new industrial uses for raw , semi-processed and waste , materials ; ;"
Production specialists are available in SBA regional offices to help individual small business concerns with technical production problems .
Production assistance often takes the form of locating tools or materials which are urgently needed .
Advice is given also on problems of plant location and plant space .
The Administration maintains a productive facilities inventory of small business industrial concerns that have voluntarily registered .
It is kept in each Regional office for the small firms within the region .

Neither growth nor a development program can be imposed on a country ; ;
"Second , we can make assistance for particular projects conditional on the consistency of such projects with the program ."
designing the financial mechanisms of the economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation ; ;
and administrative practices which will make possible the more effective review and implementation of programs once established .
"The application of conditions in the allocation of aid funds cannot , of course , be mechanical ."
It must be recognized that countries at different stages of development have very different capabilities of meeting such conditions .
A systematic approach to development budgeting and programing is one important kind of self-help .
External aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help .
The major areas of self-help are the following : ( A ) the effective mobilizing of resources .
It also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate projects after they are completed .
In many instances it can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such efforts .
How long it will take to show substantial success in this effort will vary greatly from country to country .
It is not a tool for dealing with these crises after they have erupted .
Many of the individual projects for which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy periods .
"Dams , river development schemes , transportation networks , educational systems require years to construct ."
The capital expansion programs of business firms involve multi-year budgeting and the same is true of country development programs .
or a skilled labor force is trained before there are plants available in which they can be employed .
"They must be induced to establish the necessary tax , fiscal , monetary , and regulatory policies ."
They must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary self-help measures which are described in the preceding section .
"Moreover , once these steps are taken , they may require years to make themselves felt ."
Then I have seen the pride of country well in the eyes of these young people .
"And he said , `` The same fellow who has been running it , Sam Rayburn '' ."
Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts ? ?
I purposely refrained from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from the State of Texas .
In this my first year as a Member of this body I have experienced many memorable moments .
Many of these experiences are so important that they will be cherished forever by me .
He was fatherly in his handling of all subjects with me and tremendously wise in his counsel .
I am highly privileged today to commemorate the brilliant career of this parliamentary giant .
May the Divine Speaker in Heaven bless this country with Sam Rayburn's continued service here for years to come .
He has become in this half century the grand old man of American history .
"For Sam Rayburn never forgot Bonham , his home community , and he never forgot Texas ."
There is no such thing as being diligent about national affairs but indifferent about home needs .
No one has sponsored more progressive and important legislation than has Sam Rayburn .
He is the recognized `` father '' of the Rural Electrification Administration and the Security and Exchange Commission .
My sincere wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today .
Others may speak of Speaker Rayburn's uniquely long and devoted service ; ;
"In this role of father confessor , he has always been most characteristic and most helpful ."
The practice of state-owned vehicles for use of employees on business dates back over forty years .
The legislature's role in policy determination concerning state-owned vehicles has been confined almost exclusively to appropriating funds for vehicles .
The purchase of compact ( economy ) cars is being made currently on a test basis .
Cars are traded mostly on a three-year basis in the interest of economy .
The factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible according to circumstances .
Unsuccessful efforts have been made to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles .
It is reasonably economical for the state to have drivers garage state cars at their homes .
The state has recently undertaken liability insurance for drivers of state cars .
"Twenty-six states operate a central motor pool for acquisition , allocation and/or maintenance of state-owned vehicles ."
"Nineteen states report laws , policies or regulations for assigning state vehicles in lieu of paying mileage allowances ."
Fixed monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same purpose except on a non-itemized basis .
Both allowances are governed by conditions and restrictions set forth in detail in the state's Travel Regulations .
Actual mileage allowances are well-administered and not unduly expensive for the state .
"The travel regulations , requirements and procedures governing reimbursement are controlled properly and not overly restrictive ."
They have a great advantage in ease of audit time and payment .
Travel allowances are well-regulated and pose little problem in administration and/or audit control .
At that time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties .
"Once the principle was established , the increase in state-owned vehicles came rapidly ."
"It does not indicate loose management , ineffective controls or poor policy ."
The fact is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them .
The state was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual .
It contracts with outside repair garages for much of the latter work .
Where the pool excels is in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses .
"From this , motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data ."
One matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities .
Good facilities would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle costs even more .
The purchase of state-owned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state .
Unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public .
This is a normal governmental procedure which reflects more accurately cost-accounting principles .
The assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is another matter to be covered in detail later .
At the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as well .
"These problems are not local to Rhode Island , but are recognized as common to all states ."
Rhode Island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the town in which it is situated .
"In defining personal property , it specifically mentions `` all ships or vessels , at home or abroad '' ."
Intangible property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater portion of the year .
"Both boats and aircraft would fall within this category , as well as motor vehicles ."
"This situation resulted in both towns claiming the tax , and probably justifiably ."
The Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council in its publication once commented : ``
The wording of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different interpretations .
Boats were indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats .
So few answered the question relating to their efforts to assess movable property that the results are inconclusive .
Only four towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind .
Of greater interest is a question as to whether movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership .
"Of those who have an opinion , it seems that assessment by location is preferred ."
Interest has been shown for a number of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats .
No one really knows how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may be .
"Magazine advertising included Management Methods , The New Englander , U. S. Investor , and Plant Location ."
"Among foreign countries responding were Germany , Canada , Brazil and India ."
"Morning sessions included addresses by Ward Miller , Jr. of the U. S. Dept. of Commerce ."
These objectives are stated here because of their importance in understanding the current activities of the Planning Division .
The planning division will take the initiative in encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government ; ;
The planning division has embarked on the most complete and comprehensive state planning program in the nation .
"The work program , as it was originally proposed , was to take five years to complete ."
"With these maps completed , the inventory phase of the plan has been started ."
The collection of information is meaningless unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose .
"However , a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government ."
A review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report .
"( Georgia , Iowa , Kentucky , Maine , Maryland , Minnesota , Virginia , and South Carolina ) ."
"The remaining twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state , city and local governments ."
It enables towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash discounts .
The uniform fiscal year promotes more careful budgeting and strengthens control over expenditures .
"By fixing the tax rate in advance of spending , upper limits are set on expenditures ."
The uniform fiscal year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes .
When towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons ; ;
"and as the cost of local government increases , the demand for such comparison also increases ."
"Of all advantages , probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes ."
In any event it is a form of borrowing which could be and should be rendered unnecessary .
These involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal uniformity than they do actual disadvantages to the principle .
It usually means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period of time .
But cooperation and understanding between local officials and the citizenry help lessen this problem .
The other problem is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns .
The type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed .
"First , the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single formula ."
There are at least two problems to consider : one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar ; ;
Plans vary from the `` talking stage '' to establishing special committees to accomplish this end .
"These municipalities include : Barrington , Lincoln , Middletown , Newport , North Kingstown , and South Kingstown ."
"One town and one city , Coventry and East Providence , require an adjustment of their fiscal year only ."
"These cities and towns include Bristol , Glocester , Pawtucket , Cumberland , Central Falls , and Woonsocket ."
"Two cities to be considered , Providence and Cranston , are an enigma ."
The adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them .
All of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years .
"Fortunately , such cases in Rhode Island are more the exception than the rule ."
"In addition , no two Rhode Island communities are identical in relation to their over-all financial condition ."
These factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible ; ;

The development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion .
The method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter .
The shutter consists of two parts : a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part .
Among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides OH and CH ; ;
"somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides SH , SiH , and Aj ."
High sensitivity in radio telescopes is achieved by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver ; ;
"To secure precise measurements of these frequencies , a research program in free radical microwave spectroscopy has been started ."
The first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the OH radical .
"Success in observing these spectral lines has so far , apparently , been confined to the laboratory ; ;"
Preparations are being made for similar experiments on CH and SH radicals .
This has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer .
In this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow .
Precise pressure-volume-temperature measurements on corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer .
Such a group of thermometers was obtained and calibrated at the Aj .
These thermometers have now been sent to the United Kingdom for calibration at the National Physical Laboratory .
A wall-stabilized high-current arc source was constructed and used to study transition probabilities of atomic hydrogen and oxygen .
This apparatus will also be used to measure transition probabilities of a large number of other elements .
Studies of the intensity data indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition probabilities .
Research continues on the very complex spectra of the rare earth elements .
New computer and automation techniques were applied to these spectra with considerable success .
All amounts so deducted shall be covered into the Treasury to the credit of miscellaneous receipts .
There shall be covered into the Treasury to the credit of the proper special fund all funds hereinafter specified .
Nowhere has this decline been more painfully evident than in the New York City area .
"However , there is a more profound consideration to this proposed merger than profit and loss ."
"What the next move will be only time , of course , will tell ."
"Personally , I think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of Cuba ."
"Obviously , we can't stop them from coming in , however , just by talk ."
Look at Castro now -- cockier than ever with arms and agents to threaten the Americas .
"In it they see a way to isolate Cuba , stop infiltration , maybe finish Castro , too ."
"Blockade , in the view of military and civilian experts , could restore teeth to the Monroe Doctrine ."
It could halt a flood of Communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro .
It could stop Cuban re-export of guns and propaganda materials to South America .
"As a possible course of action , it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions ."
A squadron of Navy jets and another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier task forces .
Three requirements go with a blockade : It must be proclaimed ; ;
"Blockade runners can be stopped -- by gunfire , if necessary -- searched and held , at least temporarily ."
They could be sent to U.S. ports for rulings whether cargo should be confiscated .
"In a broad sense , it would reaffirm the Monroe Doctrine by opposing Communist interference in the Western Hemisphere ."
"It could , by avoiding direct intervention , provide a short-of-war strategy to meet short-of-war infiltration ."
"Primary target would be shipments of tanks , guns , aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from Russia and Czechoslovakia ."
Shipments of arms from Western countries could similarly be seized as contraband .
"At times , three ships a day from the Soviet bloc are unloading in Cuban ports ."
Subsequent sections on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure .

Multiply the population of each State by the square of its allotment percentage .
Determine the ratio that the amount being allotted is to the sum of the products for all the States .
Funds allotted in addition to their minimum allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine .
"For purposes of this explanation , this percentage is referred to as the State's `` unadjusted Federal share '' ."
Determine the average per capita income for the United States for the last three years .
The wooden bracing between the roof beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall .
Concrete blocks are passed between the beams and put on the boards .
The roof blocks are in two layers and are not mortared together .
The last roof boards are covered with blocks from outside the shelter .
"When the roof blocks are all in place , the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position ."
"Solid concrete blocks , relatively heavy and dense , are used for this shelter ."
These blocks are sold in various sizes so it seldom is necessary to cut a block to fit .
Solid blocks are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete to give effective protection .
More detailed instructions may be obtained from your local building supply houses and craftsmen .
"An outdoor , aboveground fallout shelter also may be built with concrete blocks ."
) Most people would have to hire a contractor to build this shelter .
The walls are held together with metal ties placed in the wet mortar as the walls are built .
Pre-shaped corrugated metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground .
These are particularly suitable for regions where water or rock is close to the surface .
The same shelter could be built into an embankment or below ground level .
"Therefore , sharp turns in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter ."
Ventilation is provided in a concrete block basement shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance .
A blower is essential for the double-wall shelter and for the underground shelters .
Radio reception is cut down by the shielding necessary to keep out radiation .
As soon as the shelter is completed a radio reception check must be made .
"It probably will be necessary to install an outside antenna , particularly to receive CONELRAD broadcasts ."
A flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a brighter light is needed .
There should be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue in many areas .
The basement or belowground shelters also will serve for tornado or hurricane protection .
But the radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous .
"Therefore , civil defense instructions received over CONELRAD or by other means should be followed ."
There is a possibility that battery-powered radios with built-in radiation meters may become available .
Your local civil defense will gather its own information and will receive broad information from State and Federal sources .
There should be a task for everyone and these tasks should be rotated .
Part of the family should be sleeping while the rest is awake .
To break the monotony it may be necessary to invent tasks that will keep the family busy .
The survival of the family will depend largely on information received by radio .
"A record should be kept of the information and instructions , including the time and date of broadcast ."
The housekeeping problems of living in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied .
Sanitation in the confines of the family shelter will require much thought and planning .
Provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human wastes will be an unfamiliar problem .
A covered container such as a kitchen garbage pail might do as a toilet .
Body heat in the close quarters will help keep up the temperature .
"Few areas , if any , are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about ."
A family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding from fallout radiation .
On the ground floor the radiation would be about half what it is outside .
The best protection would be on the ground floor in the central part of the house .
A belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation to one-tenth of the outside level .
The safest place is the basement corner least exposed to windows and deepest below ground .
Large apartment buildings of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual family dwellings .
The problem for the city apartment dweller is primarily to plan the use of existing space .
Such planning will require the cooperation of other occupants and of the apartment management .
Lines of communications were established between the two companies and several Du Pont products were actively promoted .
The purpose of this provision was thus explained in the Court's opinion : ``
"Thus , a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court's decision ."
that these products constituted a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton Act ; ;
that General Motors' share of the market for these products was substantial ; ;
The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition .
The sole guidance given the Court for discharging the task committed to it was this : ``
This brings us to the course of the proceedings in the District Court .
The Court adopted this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out .
One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage .
Haydn C. Covington argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner .
"On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin , Assistant Attorney General Wilkey , Beatrice Rosenberg and J. F. Bishop ."
We granted certiorari in view of the importance of the questions in the administration of the Act .
"There followed a customary Department of Justice hearing , at which petitioner appeared ."
"The appeal board , however , unanimously concurred in the Department's recommendation ."
But the statement of the local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file .
"This he failed to do , asserting that he did not know it to be in his file ."
Nevertheless he had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board .
nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the Federal Bureau of Investigation reports might disclose .
It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the appeal board .
Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board .
"In addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes ."
"But this is fully answered by United States v. Nugent , supra ."
"Even if we were not bound by Nugent , petitioner here would not be entitled to the report ."
We in this Department must think about foreign policy in its total context .
Foreign policy is the total involvement of the American people with peoples and governments abroad .
Assistant Secretaries of State will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination of policies .
I think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action .
We want to stimulate ideas from the bottom to the top of the Department .
I hope no one expects that only Presidential appointees are looked upon as sources of ideas .
"Further , I would hope that we could pay attention to little things ."
"He is expected to supervise , to encourage , to direct , to assist in any way he can ."
Whether it will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine .
The policy officer lives with his antennae alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility .
"He is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action , including doing nothing ."
He is aware that every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other problem .
He must think of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer .
Who should be consulted among his colleagues in the Department or other departments and agencies of the Government ? ?
"What is the probable attitude of other governments , including those less directly involved ? ?"
How and at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted ? ?
"If action is indicated , what kind of action is relevant to the problem ? ?"
Is the matter one for the United Nations or some other international body ? ?
"What type of action can hope to win public support , first in this country and then abroad ? ?"
What the American people will do turns in large degree on their leadership .
And the policy officer has the hounds of time snapping at his heels .
In most cases service in the Corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary deferment .
Peace Corps volunteers obviously should not be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the United States .
The guiding principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual services .
Peace Corps volunteers should be given just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living .
"Perhaps existing Public Health Service , State Department and Armed Services medical facilities can be utilized ."
In what part of the government should the Peace Corps be established ? ?
The idea of a Peace Corps has captured the imagination of a great many people .
"Support for it cuts across party , regional , ethnic and other lines ."
"When the aid operations are reorganized the Peace Corps should remain a semi-autonomous , functional unit ."
Nor should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university campuses .
It can then grow steadily as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated .
In the first year there should probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects .
"The first year's projects should also be spread through several countries in Latin America , Africa and Asia ."
A certain skepticism about the coming of Americans is to be expected in many quarters .
Unfriendly political groups will no doubt do everything in their power to promote active hostility .
The Peace Corps is not a diplomatic or propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership .
"If presented in this spirit , the response and the results will be immeasurably better ."
Congress should then be asked to give the Peace Corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year .
"No matter how well conceived and efficiently run , there probably will be failures ."
These could be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad .
"But as the popular response suggests , the potentiality of the Peace Corps is very great ."
It can also contribute to the education of America and to more intelligent American participation in the world .
I have today signed an Executive Order establishing a Peace Corps on a temporary pilot basis .
Its initial expenses will be paid from appropriations currently available for our foreign aid program .
( B ) more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread damage ; ;
( C ) quicker and more effective control action in the initial stages to prevent a large-scale epidemic .
The initial suppression activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated .
Coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses .
This will include a stepped-up program of training and development of personnel .
Reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize the chances of large fires developing and spreading to high-value areas .
These areas comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation on the National Forests .
Control would be limited to those rodents for which economical means of control are known .

Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets .
There have been few measurements specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation .
The concept of apparent black-body temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets .
Mare Imbrium seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which surround it .
These contour diagrams also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness with latitude .
"Thus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc ."
The high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation .
In plasma generators the superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat .
Heat of condensation ( work function ) plus kinetic energy of the electrons impinging on the anode .
Heat transfer by molecular conduction as well as by radiation from the arc column .
"Hence , the flow conditions at the anode of free burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point ."
The gas flow through a plasma generator will modify these conditions ; ;
"however , the anode is still the part receiving the largest heat flux ."
Continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic forces .
Feedback of the energy transferred to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode .
A detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper .
Argon was used as a blowing gas to exclude any effects of dissociation or chemical reaction .
The experimental arrangement as described below is based on the geometry of free burning arcs .
This tube could be adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing .
The transpiring gas ejected from the anode formed a jet directed axially towards the cathode below .
This small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving the anode .
A shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream temperature of the transpiring gas .
This arrangement had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection .
Three thermocouples were placed at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature .
"In addition , the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil to reduce radiation ."
The argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator .
The arc voltage was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode and cathode holders .
"Because of the falling characteristic of the rectifier , no ballast resistor was required for stability of operation ."
The argon flow through the porous anode was varied systematically between Af and Af .
This region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the anode surface changed size and location continuously .
"To measure the surface temperature of the anode plug , the surface was scanned with a pyrometer ."
"As it turned out , a very hot region occurred on the plug ."
The rest of the surface had a temperature which decreased towards the outer diameter of the plug .
They showed no marked dependence on the flow rate within the accuracy of these measurements .
It was calculated from the temperature gradient Af at Af inch as Af .
The total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby Af .
It consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims .
There is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed .
"After it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded ."
"By the use of various weights , data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained ."
The instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described .
"Although there were only four fluids tested , it was apparent that there were two distinct types ."
The actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand .
Such an instrument would be useful for the characterization of many commercial materials as well as theoretical studies .
Af is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to H .
The minimum total potential energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to H and equating to zero .
This method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields .
The relation between osmotic pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an analogous way .
"If the mechanics are similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar ."
"According to Philippoff , the recoverable shear S is given by Af where **yc is the angle of extinction ."
"These droplets appear to be ellipsoids , and it is mathematically convenient to assume that they are ."
"If they are not ellipsoids , the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation ."
") This is , of course , a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence studies ."
"This viscosity of the material in the drops is , of course , not negligible ."
Measurements on the photograph in this paper give Af at the maximum rate of shear of Af .
The internal energy of an ideal gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume .
The energy for any isothermal work done by the perfect gas must come as thermal energy from its surroundings .
A proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline Af as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented .
"Af is paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening ."
An isotropic resonance shift of Af to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction .
"The theory predicts a linear dependence of Af on Af , where J is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant ."
The experimental second moment Af conforms to the relation Af in agreement with theory .
"Hence , the electron paramagnetic effects ( slope ) can be separated from the nuclear effects ( intercept ) ."
There is ample evidence from many sources that the Af bond in Af is symmetric .
He finds the structure contains an Af bond with the Af distance of Af .
"Douglass found Af to be trigonal , Laue symmetry Af , with Af , Af ."
Douglass found powder intensity calculations and measurements to agree best for Af .
These data lead to a structure in which sheets of Cr atoms lie between two sheets of O atoms .
"The structure appears to be unique among OOH compounds , but is the same as that assumed by Af ."
The bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal .
"Subsequently , we learned from Douglass that his sample contained a few percent Af impurity ."
"Since Af is ferromagnetic , we felt that any results obtained from the magnetically contaminated Af would be suspect ."
This latter reaction is in accord with the reported decomposition of Af .
Magnetic analyses by R. G. Meisenheimer of this laboratory indicated no ferromagnetic impurities .
The particles appeared rough and undoubtedly the single-crystal domains are smaller than this .
The spectrometer was adjusted to minimize the amount of dispersion mode mixed in with the absorption signal .
A single value of the thermal relaxation time Af at room temperature was measured by the progressive saturation method .
"Corrections were applied for modulation broadening , apparatus background , and field shift ."
Such a density corresponds to a paramagnetic ion density of about Af .
The top of the sample was nearly flat and the bottom hemispherical .
This sample was contained in a cylindrical container similar to that described above .
"The best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use ."
The better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders .
An oversimplified differentiation between soft- and hard-surface cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved .
One gram of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of Af .
There are considerable differences between the requirements for textile and hard-surface cleaning .
A good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many washings ; ;
Soil redeposition is evaluated by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones .
"In hard-surface cleaning , the inorganic salts are more important than the organic active ."
"Hydroxides , orthophosphates , borates , carbonates , and silicates are important inorganic ingredients of hard-surface cleaners ."
"In addition , the polyphosphates are also used , probably acting more as peptizing agents than anything else ."
The importance of the inorganic constituents in hard-surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers .
"Greasy soils , which are typified by hydrocarbons and fats ( esters of glycerol with long-chain organic acids ) ."
"Miscellaneous soils , which primarily include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave a residue ."
The dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically held by surface irregularities to some extent .
"Greases , stains , and miscellaneous soils are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface ."
"In most cases , these soils are taken up as liquids through capillary action ."
The detergent active is that substance which primarily acts to remove greasy soils .
"In the cleaning process , sorbed greasy soils become coated in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant ."
"This is particularly true of highly charged ions , especially those ions which fall into the class of polyelectrolytes ."
The negatively charged dirt particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase .
This hypothesis is evolved in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic actives in detergency .
The crude picture of the detergency process thus far developed can be represented as : Af .
It is evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent constituent acting alone are severe .
"Despite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure reagents , serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction ."
The reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies .
Previously purified chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange was allowed to take place .
The round cells were reproducibly positioned in the light beam which entered the thermostated mineral oil-bath through a window .
Calcium hydride was substituted for Af as a drying agent for carbon tetrachloride .
No correlation between these variables and the irreproducibility of the results was found .
Rather large differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings .
In all cases there was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of illumination .
"Exchange was also observed in these cells , which had chlorine present at Af ."
At one astronomical unit from the sun ( the Earth's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular .
This effect can give rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth .
One cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in space .
"At greater distances from the sun , the situation is still less certain ."
Direct information has been obtained from rockets and satellites equipped with impact sensors .
The cores of deep-sea sediments and content of collectors in remote regions are valuable in this category .
The data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth .
"these instruments are installed on rockets , satellites , and space probes ."
this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration and an assumed impact velocity of Af .
"for the next two days , the impact rate was Af ; ;"
"Being based on so few events , these results are of dubious validity ."
The calibration of piezoelectric sensors in terms of the particle parameters is very uncertain .
"In the United States , most of the sensors are calibrated by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces ."
This `` ejection '' momentum is linearly related to the particle energy .
these figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in interplanetary space near the Earth .
Note that the mass scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously used ; ;
The older scales were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into light .
Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites .
"At the fifteenth magnitude , Af , and at the twenty-fifth magnitude , Af ."
"Present data indicate an accretion of about Af tons per year over the entire globe , or about Af ."
Man may also be injured secondarily by damage to his food crops or domestic animals .
The major reason for this is that it has no quick-kill effect .
A man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious diseases .
"Thus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities ."
The biological and physical properties of infectious particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen years .
Much information has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling and assesment techniques .
Much of the older experimental work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial procedures .
The importance of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated .
The entrance and retention of infectious particles in the alveoli amounts almost to an intratissue inoculation .
"For example , bright sunlight is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air ."
Neutral or inversion meteorological conditions are necessary for a cloud to travel along the surface .
The smaller the particle the further it will travel downwind before settling out .
The secondary consequences from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense .
Something of the behavior of clouds of small particles can be illustrated by the following field trials :
This material fluoresces under ultraviolet light which facilitates its sampling and assessment .
These dosages could have been increased by increasing the source strength which was small in this case .
"All samplers were operated for a period of two hours except one , which was operated for four hours ."
"This suggests that the sampling period , particularly at the more distant locations , should have been increased ."
"It is quite likely that an even greater area was covered , particularly downwind ."
The dosages in the three levels of the vertical profile were : Af
"Botulinal toxin , for example , is several thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when given per os ."
"In some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure , making diagnosis difficult ."
An enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious .
"It is , obviously , a proper goal of research to improve on this property ."
In this connection it should be capable of being disseminated without excessive destruction .
A solid immunity is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized .
There is a broad spectrum of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose might be made .
It is possible that certain mutational forms may be produced such as antibiotic resistant strains .
Mutants may also be developed with changes in biochemical properties that are of importance in identification .
All of these considerations are of critical importance in considering defense and medical management .
They do not destroy physical structures as is true of high explosives .
This is why this approach to BW defense has not been given major attention .
Our major problem is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target .
No epidemic was initiated nor was one expected because the population in City A was not lousy .
This was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic .
One might expect some spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness of the attack .
It should be no more difficult to deliver such devices than other weapons .
"The same delivery vehicles -- whether they be airplanes , submarines or guided missiles -- should be usable ."
"Biological agents are , moreover , suitable for delivery through enemy sabotage which imposes many problems in defense ."
The air conditioning and ventilating systems of large buildings are subject to attack .
"America is rapidly becoming a nation that uses processed , precooked and even predigested foods ."
One must include the preparation of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk products .
A variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies .
"These include low-temperature ethanol ( Cohn ) fractionation , electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses ."
Modifications of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators .
"Serum samples were obtained from normal group A , group B and group O donors ."
Three of the anti-Rh sera used were taken from recently sensitized individuals .
These antibody titers were determined by reaction with homozygous Af red cells .
The saline tubes were saved and used for the indirect Coombs test in the following manner .
The anti-human sera used were prepared by injecting whole human serum into rabbits .
"In all cases , most of the activity lay in the region of high anionic binding capacity ."
"These fractions were tested for ABO agglutinin activity , using fractions from group AB plasma as a control ."
"Once again , both anti-A and anti-B activities were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis ."
Chromatography of whole sera revealed that the areas of Rh antibody activity were generally continuous and wide .
The incomplete antibody activity appeared in the early part of the chromatogram ; ;
The insoluble material resulting from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity .
"Apart from the honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor ."
"Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease ."
Each male willow catkin is composed of a large number of small flowers .
"By scrutinizing the flowers , one can also notice that the scale bears one or two tiny warts ."
"The staminate willow catkins , then , provide their visitors with both nectar and pollen ; ;"
The only exception to this is certain bees that have become parasites .
She also builds one or two waxen cups which she fills with honey .
"The larvae , kept warm by the queen , are full grown in about ten days ."
males and mating females do not emerge until later in the season .
Female individuals of Psithyrus look deceptively like the workers and queens of the bumblebees they victimize .
The female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host .
"The hosts never seem to recognize that something is amiss , so that the compartment afterward is sealed normally ."
"Later on , they and the mother Psithyrus are fed by the Bombus workers ."
"But let us return , after this gruesome interlude , to our willow catkins in the spring ; ;"
"Their appearance , next spring , coincides in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants ."
"This must be due to a completely identical response to the weather , in the plant and the animal ."
"After the male and female andrenas have mated , the cycle is repeated ."
"The way in which it transports its pollen is not so perfect , either ."
"Often the burrows are only an inch or two apart , and the bee cities cover several acres ."
The name `` alkali bee '' indicates that one has to look for them in rather inhospitable places .
"Sometimes , although by no means always , these are indeed alkaline ."
The thing is that these bees love a fine-grained soil that is moist ; ;
Many other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length .
It is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; ;
"he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect ."
It is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves .
Let us speculate a little on the maximum size of the anaconda .
"The African rock python , a close second , is followed in turn by the reticulate python ."
it responds exceptionally well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to keep .
I cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth ; ;
at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches rather than feet .
Another approach is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at maturity .
Only the amethystine python and the anaconda must be excluded for lack or paucity of data .
"These three were much alike : lined snake ( Tropidoclonion ) , one year and nine months ; ;"
Klauber investigated the rattlesnakes carefully himself and also summarized what others have found .
Carpenter's study showed that female common garter and ribbon snakes of Michigan mature at about the age of two .
every snake hide is noticeably longer than its carcass and intentional stretching presents no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer .
"In spite of all the pitfalls , there is a certain amount of agreement on some of the giants ."
the relatively wild conditions still found in tropical South America might be responsible .
"The next level attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced , sensible conclusion ; ;"
The third level leans on a belief that a lot of smoke means some fire .
Detailed information on record lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows .
the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower limit of the Brookfield brood and its average .
It is very unlikely that either of these anacondas was growing at a normal rate .
"However , as a field measurement , it is open to question ."
It is possible that especially large anacondas will prove to belong to subspecies limited to a small area .
final conclusions will have to await the measurements of broods from definite localities .
I have surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity .
What data there are on growth indicate considerable variation in rate ; ;
The bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout .
It is characterized by the presence of incompletely developed secondary lobules ; ;
The bronchial artery in its course and distribution differs somewhat from that found in other mammals .
This pleural supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular bronchial artery branches .
"With completion of filling , net-like anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately derived branches ."
An unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries present within the substance of the lung was noted .
This was accounted for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following the pulmonary artery .
In distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that of the pulmonary artery .
Also three other direct pathways of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted : via the pleura ; ;
It is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made .
The significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic differences been determined .
"Also , interlobular air drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow ; ;"
probably occur in the horse much as in the human being ; ;
A reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking at present .
The meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial artery as found in the horse is not clear .
The possibility that the absence or presence of these shunts is species-dependent is therefore inferred .
The main subgross anatomical features of the lungs of various mammals are presented .
A tabulation of these features permits the lungs to be grouped into three distinctive subgross types .
This may be due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barriers present .
The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children .
"Third , the upper portion deals with only two indicators of developmental level , Onset and Completion ."
The lower portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood .
"It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement ."
"For the boy , this epiphysis was markedly delayed at Onset but near the mean at Completion ."
"In contrast , for the girl the epiphysis was slightly advanced at Onset and delayed at Completion ."
"Obviously , the slowing for her may have occurred at any point between Onset and Completion ."
It is of interest that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls in this group .
thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage would appear possible for only seven boys .
The `` dot '' on his arrow indicates early Onset and the `` tip '' indicates relatively later Completion .
The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood .
"However , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems ."
"In addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine ."
"Iodination of tyrosine , however , is not enough for the synthesis of hormone ."
The mono- and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine .
There is so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is under enzymatic control .
"In addition , depending on availability of dietary iodine , thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of iodine ."
The presence of several proteases and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid .
"This de-iodinating enzyme is effective against mono- and di-iodotyrosine , but does not de-iodinate thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine ."
The thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine released by proteolysis and so escaping de-iodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream .
"It has been shown that thyroglobulin binds thyroxine , but the binding does not appear to be particularly strong ."
This ion inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis by interfering with iodide concentration in the thyroid .
The other group of antithyroid agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil .
"These drugs have no effect on the iodide concentrating mechanism , but they inhibit organification ."
"The antithyroid drugs of the thiouracil type , however , are not antagonised by such means ."
"Besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol types , certain antithyroid drugs have been found in naturally occurring foods ."
It is presumed to occur in other members of the Brassica family .
"Further , the gland is able to re-use a larger fraction of the thyroid hormone de-iodinated peripherally ."
"Additional findings at this time included cardiomegaly , peripheral arteriosclerosis obliterans , and cholelithiasis ."
"Later , chlorothiazide and salt restriction became necessary to control the edema of chronic congestive failure ."
The clinical impression at this time was either muscular dystrophy or polymyositis .
"Muscle weakness did not improve , and the patient needed first a cane , then crutches ."
"There were bilateral pterygia and arcus senilis , and the mouth was edentulous ."
The valves were normal except for thin yellow plaques on the inferior surface of the mitral leaflets .
"In addition , other sections contained focal areas of recent myocardial necrosis that were infiltrated with neutrophils ."
"Many of the myocardial fibers were hypertrophied and had large , irregular , basophilic nuclei ."
The intima of the larger coronary arteries was thickened by fibrous tissue containing fusiform clefts and mononuclear cells .
"The endothelial cells lining the sinusoids were prominent , and many contained large quantities of hemosiderin ."
"Microscopically , there was hyperemia of the central veins , and there was some atrophy of adjacent parenchyma ."
"Some liver cord cells contained vacuolated cytoplasm , while others had small amounts of brown hemosiderin pigment ."
A careful search failed to show occlusion of any of the mesenteric vessels .
"Microscopically , the mucosa of the stomach showed extensive cytolysis and contained large numbers of Gram-negative bacterial rods ."
"Some of the small vessels were filled with fibrin thrombi , and there was extensive interstitial hemorrhage ."
"Cultures taken from the jejunum yielded Monilia albicans , Pseudomonas pyocanea , Aerobacter aerogenes , and Streptococcus anhemolyticus ."
"Throughout , there were marked arteriolosclerosis and hyalinization of afferent glomerular arterioles ."
These changes were more marked in the atrophic right kidney than in the left .
"The bone of the vertebral bodies , ribs , and sternum was soft and was easily compressed ."
The marrow of the vertebral bodies was pale and showed areas of fatty replacement .
"Microscopically , there were many areas of hypercellularity alternating with areas of hypocellularity ."
"The cells of the erythroid , myeloid , and megakaryocytic series were normal except for their numbers ."
"In association with these changes in the fibers , there were striking alterations in the muscle nuclei ."
"Individual nuclei were usually oval to round , though occasionally elongated , and frequently small and somewhat pyknotic ."
"In all of the sections examined , the arterioles and small arteries were essentially normal ."
Rinsing the sections with PBS before layering the intermediate sera did not improve the staining reaction .
Nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily eliminated by passing these conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column as described for Af .
This indicates that increase in specificity of Af after passing it through DEAE-cellulose was not merely due to dilution .
This was chiefly because of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cells .
The autofluorescence from the walls of the xylem cells was particularly brilliant .
Within the pseudophloem cells the distribution of WTV antigen was irregular in the cytoplasm .
No antigen was detectable in certain dark spherical areas in most cells .
"In both the direct and indirect methods of staining , the conjugates had nonspecifically staining fractions ."
"Moreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions ."
Previous experiences are obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response .
Facilitatory processes take place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending and descending pathways .
"Apparently , a positive feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex ."
This tendency can be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or via cortico-hypothalamic pathways .
It is believed that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism .
"With the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus , the opposite changes occur ."
Similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes in man and animals .
Of particular importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect .
"The former comprise analeptic and psychoactive drugs , the latter the tranquilizers ."
The emotional states produced by drugs influence the cortical potentials in a characteristic manner ; ;
"However , if these procedures are applied more often , conditioned emotional responses are temporarily abolished ."
An important observation of Pavlov served as a guide post to achieve such a reversibility by physiological means .
"In a conditioning experiment , he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding and pain ."
A mild electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus and was followed by feeding .
The pain became thus the symbol for food and elicited salivary secretion ( conditioned reflex ) .
"Even when the intensity of the shocks was increased gradually , it failed to evoke any signs of pain ."
The feeding-pain antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the tropho- and ergotropic systems .
"Furthermore , a functional antagonism exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety ."
"If we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems ."
"this is really a deficiency in the scalar field , namely , that it is not algebraically closed ."
This will be more or less our general method for the second problem .
The diagonalizable operator is the special case of this in which Af for each i .
Let T be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional vector space V over the field F .
The projection Af will be the identity on Af and zero on the other Af .
We shall show that the polynomials Af behave in the manner described in the first paragraph of the proof .
"Since Af and P divides Af for Af , we have Af ."
Thus the Af are projections which correspond to some direct-sum decomposition of the space V .
We wish to show that the range of Af is exactly the subspace Af .
"Conversely , suppose that **ya is in the null space of Af ."
"If Af , then Af is divisible by Af and so Af , i.e. , Af ."
"But then it is immediate that Af , i.e. , that **ya is in the range of Af ."
It is certainly clear that the subspaces Af are invariant under T .
"Thus Af is divisible by the minimal polynomial P of T , i.e. , Af divides Af ."
Now the range of Af is the null space Af of Af .
We say that N is nilpotent if there is some positive integer R such that Af .
Let T be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional vector space V over the field F .
Suppose that the minimal polynomial for T decomposes over F into a product of linear polynomials .
"Now suppose that we also have Af where D' is diagonalizable , N' is nilpotent , and Af ."
Now we have Af or Af and all four of these operators commute with one another .
"Since N and N' are both nilpotent and they commute , the operator Af is nilpotent ; ;"
"It then follows that Af is large enough , but this is not obvious from the above expression ."
"but then since the operator is diagonalizable , the minimal polynomial cannot have a repeated root ; ;"
These operators D and N are unique and each is a polynomial in T .
Let us now regard D as a linear operator on the subspace V .
"To describe the space of solutions to Af , one must know something about differential equations ; ;"
"that is , one must know something about D other than the fact that it is a linear operator ."
It is very easy to establish by induction on R that if F is in Af then Af ; ;
Thus F satisfies Af if and only if F has the form Af .
"Accordingly , the ' functions ' Af span the space of solutions of Af ."
"Some experiments are composed of repetitions of independent trials , each with two possible outcomes ."
What can we say of the probabilities of the different possible numbers of bull's-eyes ? ?
"In general , any outcome we choose may be labeled `` success '' ."
"Fortunately , a general formula of wide applicability solves all problems of this kind ."
"Before deriving this formula , we explain what we mean by `` problems of this kind '' ."
"Experiments are often composed of several identical trials , and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated ."
Each Friday one manager is chosen by lot to stay late and load the equipment on a truck .
"Since the choice is by lot each week , the outcomes of different trials are independent ."
"The managers stay the same , so that Af is the same for all weeks ."
Below we use our earlier examples to describe and illustrate these four properties .
"We also give , for each property , an example where the property is absent ."
"For the marksman , we study sets of five shots ( Af ) ; ;"
"for the mice , we restrict attention to litters of eight ( Af ) ; ;"
"and for the aces , we toss three dice ( Af ) ."
"Here the number of trials is a random variable , not a fixed number ."
Each of the N trials is either a success or a failure .
These words are more expressive than labels like `` A '' and `` not-A '' .
"We classify mice as `` straight-haired '' or `` wavy-haired '' , but a hairless mouse appears ."
"Note that we need not know the value of p , for the experiment to be binomial ."
"Experimentally , we expect independence when the trials have nothing to do with one another ."
We want to know the number of people going to the mountains .
"Indeed , the experiment is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire family ."
Each person votes for one of a pair of pictures to receive a popular prize .
"Voting for one picture may be called `` success '' , for the other `` failure '' ."
"An experiment consists of the voting of one couple , or two trials ."
"For example , we are interested in the number of bull's-eyes , not which shots were bull's-eyes ."
A binomial experiment can produce random variables other than the number of successes .
The constancy of P and the independence are the conditions most likely to give trouble in practice .
"that is , we may discuss the phenomenon in terms of its departures from the binomial model ."
"The random variable X takes the values Af with probabilities Af or , more briefly Af ."
We shall find a formula for the probability of exactly X successes for given values of P and N .
"The marksman gets two bull's-eyes , one on his third shot and one on his fifth ."
"Their sum is X , the total number of successes , which in this experiment has the value Af ."
"For the vertex at Af , these values will be denoted by Af ."
"The graph , as a set , may have a finite number of components ."
We will denote the values of f{t} on different components by Af .
Each point with abscissa T on the graph represents an intersection between C and Af .
Any other point of intersection between C and Af will be called a tangent point .
This terminology will also be applied to the corresponding points in the Aj .
We know that in the C-plane both C and Af are analytic .
"Near Q , both curves can be represented by analytic functions of U ."
"In a neighborhood of Q the difference between these functions is also a single-valued , analytic function of U ."
"Now , to find Af , one needs the intersection of C and Af near Q ."
We turn now to the set of tangent points on the graph .
This prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points .
A tangent point Q in the C-plane occurs when C and Af are tangent to one another .
There are three possibilities : ( A ) Af remains tangent to C as it is translated ; ;
( B ) Af moves away from C and does not intersect it at all for Af ; ;
( C ) Af cuts across C and there are two ordinary intersections for every T in Af .
In the second category the function Af has no values defined in a neighborhood Af .
The same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of Af .
"Again , the analyticity of the two curves guarantees that such intervals exist ."
With the above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of F .
The number of ordinary values of the function f{t} at T will be called its multiplicity at T .
The graph of f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval Aj .
Then every component of the graph of F must be defined over a bounded sub-interval .
Now Af and Af must both be tangent points on the T component in the f-plane ; ;
Thus the multiplicity of Af for a given T must be an even number .
This is true of all components which have such a bounded support .
"But this is a contradiction , for we know that the multiplicity of f{t} is odd for every T ."
"There must be an odd number of such components , which will be called complete components ."
We again consider a fixed point P at Af and a variable point Q at Af on C .
The functions F and B have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument T .
"We define these values as Af , and define g{t} in the same way for each T ."
Thus we obtain g{t} by introducing an oblique g{t}-axis in the Aj .
No generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible .
Hence the totality of singular lines is the T order complex of lines which meet Aj .
"The class of the congruence is Af , since an arbitrary plane meets **zg in K points ."
"There are various sets of exceptional lines , or lines whose images are not unique ."
Thus pencils of tangents to Q are transformed into pencils of tangents .
"In particular , tangents to C are transformed into tangents to C' ."
The congruence of its secants is therefore of order Af and class Af .
"In other words , these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all ."
"Hence its image , C' , meets any line of Af in Af points ."
"Moreover , C' obviously meets any line Af in a single point ."
We now shall show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described .
"To see this , consider a general pencil of lines containing a general secant of Aj ."
"However , since the pencil contains a secant of **zg it actually contains only Af singular lines ."
The first possibility requires that there be a line through P which meets **zg in Af points ; ;
the second requires that there be a line through P which meets **zg in Af points .
Observations similar to these can be made at each point of Aj .
Hence **zg must have either a regulus of Af-fold secants or a regulus of Af-fold secants .
"Moreover , if Af , no two of the multiple secants can intersect ."
"Now consider an arbitrary line , l , meeting Q in two points , Af and Af ."
new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence ; ;
"As a nation , we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development ; ;"
"Isolated enterprises have been launched , but they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern ."
In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals .
The civil services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them ; ;
Only within the framework of a mature relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can we provide telling assistance .
Land reform is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries .
"As an isolated policy , land reform is likely to be politically disruptive ; ;"
"as part of a larger development effort , however , it may gain wide acceptance ."
It should also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solved by administrative decrees alone .
Land reform programs need to be supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance in agriculture .
"Lastly , governmental and private planners will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming ahead ."
But these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital ; ;
they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels ; ;
Several related tasks must be carried out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved .
even the famed Indian Civil Service is not fully adequate to the tremendous range of tasks it has undertaken .
Technical assistance in training middle- and upper-level management personnel is still needed in many cases .
American policy toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional classes .
We have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries ; ;
We have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society will take a considerable period of time .
American and free-world policies can marginally affect the pace of transition ; ;
It follows that any effective policy toward the underdeveloped countries must have a realistically long working horizon .
It must be marked by a patience and persistence which have not always been its trademark .
"The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; ;"
as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it .
"In societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex ."
and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion .
"he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ;"
he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows .
Man has the experience of being helpfully allied with what he cannot fully understand ; ;
he is a coordinate part of all of the mysterious energy and being and movement .
A number of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the ultimate and eternal .
"it also provides facilities and incitements for the development of personality , sociality , and creativeness ."
"Under the religious impulse , whether theistic or humanistic , men have joy in living ; ;"
He has to cope with frustration and other emotional disturbance and anomie .
"Religion usually also includes a principle of compensation , mainly in a promised perfect future state ."
"The religion supports , re-enforces , reaffirms , and maintains the fundamental values ."
This is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of radically different value orientation elsewhere ; ;
for example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism .
This explains some group ends and provides a justification of their primacy .
It gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs of social action .
"Finally , it gives meaning to much social endeavor , and logic , consistency , and meaning to life ."
"In general , there is no society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired transcendental ends ."
"The common ultimate values , ends and goals fostered by religion are a most important factor ."
"Where such a value system prevails , it always unifies all who possess it ; ;"
The credo unifies and socializes men by attaching them completely to an identical body of doctrine ; ;
"the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine , the firmer the group ."
"The religion , in fact , is an expression of the unity of the group , small or large ."
"These are ways of jointly participating in significantly symbolized , standardized , and ordered religiously sanctified behavior ."
Much of the important individual and social action has been owing to religious incentives .
Much effort has been expended in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion .
The insuperable reward systems that most religions embody have great motivating effects .
"Religion usually acts as a powerful aid in social control , enforcing what men should or should not do ."
Soon Mrs. B.'s fears threatened to burst into a full-blown panic concerning the welfare of the entire family .
Her previous traumatic experiences flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday .
Direct confrontation and acceptance of Mrs. B.'s anger against the second baby soon dissipated her fears of annihilation .
"In general , the approach is more active than passive , more out-reaching than reflective ."
These needs usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension .
The initial interview must be therapeutic rather than purely exploratory in an information-seeking sense .
In this relationship-building stage the worker must communicate confidence in the client's ability to deal with the problem .
"Thus , the client receives enough ego support to engage in constructive efforts on his own behalf ."
Here there is a specific preventive component which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework situation .
The preferential mating of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study .
The relative geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating .
The supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation .
Maintenance of the status quo might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population today .
The process of evaluation assigns varying positive and negative priorities or values to elements .
The elements and processes become evident in a study of mate selection in this population .
core - marginal marriages still belong in the category of permissive unions ; ;
"Again , size of the group may have some influence on the strength of group controls ."
The large majority of the interviewees placed core families in the upper positions .
The comprehensive or master processes activate all or some of the elements within the social system and subsystems .
There seems to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status within the group .
"As mentioned above , where families are concentrated in larger numbers , group controls seem strongest and most effective ."
The problem of solidarity and morale again involves the concept of values .
Communication may be facilitated by means of the high visibility within the larger community .
"However , the factor of physical isolation is not a static situation ."
Urbanization appears to be an important factor in the disintegration of this group .
Examples from this population indicate that deviance seems to be sanctioned by ostracism from the group .
"'' Boundary maintenance for this group would seem to be primarily social , as is the preference for endogamy ."
"It is also expressed in the proscription against deviants in the matter of endogamy , particularly in rural areas ."
But specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors .
"Finally , the registration of births and deaths by nearest relatives was made compulsory in most regions ."
Numbers of registered persons in four age-and-sex classes were counted each year .
Averages of the ratios obtained in a few selected areas were applied to the larger population .
The sampling program was instituted before the principles of probability sampling were widely recognized in population studies .
The system was not well adapted to conditions of life in urban centers .
The distinction between domiciled ( de jure ) and present ( de facto ) population was not clearly defined .
"The system tended to break down during the war , but was reactivated ; ;"
But the information on the dynamics of population was often quite misleading .
"The same system , with minor modifications , was developed in Ruanda-Urundi under Belgian administration ."
"Before considering more recent activities , we should note another important aspect of demography in Belgian Africa ."
Its findings are reported each year in its Rapport Sur l'activite Pendant annee ( Bruxelles ) .
Somewhat similar investigations have been made by medical officers in other areas .
"Other independent , or partially independent agencies , have promoted investigations on topics directly or indirectly related to demography ."
"However , the statistical offices of both governments were assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics ."
Eventually responsibility for demographic inquiries in the Congo was transferred to the demographic division of the Central Statistical Office .
The radical nature of the innovation in the Congo was not emphasized in the official announcements .
"In short , scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective sampling ."
"Sample units ( villages in rural areas , houses in cities ) were drawn systematically within these strata ."
Higher proportions were sampled in urban and mixed communities than in rural areas .
"Uniform questions , definitions , and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country ."
"Data were obtained , separately , on three classes of persons : ( A ) residents , present ; ;"
"Finally , it may have certain very important , less obvious values ."
It is proposed that in the future complete sampling censuses be carried out at five-year intervals .
"Other reports in identical form , but with somewhat varying content , have been issued ."
"Toward the end of the semester's work , he interviewed every married class member at great length ."
"However , all admitted that the `` hindsight '' was not altogether lost ."
but they all hastened to add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent .
A few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section for married students .
I can now better see just what processes provoked certain actions from me in the past .
"In addition , two other differences in the two types of sections must be noted ."
"Many of them appear to drop out , for one reason or another ."
In the regular sections they have always been more or less discouraged .
"Besides , auditors do not count on faculty load with the same weight as regularly enrolled students ."
"After that , we began to get `` visitors '' to class ."
"Some of these speculations may have some merit , others are somewhat ambiguous ."
But within that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible .
Or `` How do we enrich our already fine marriage '' ? ?
"Films were used , as with all sections , but with one big difference ."
The writer never knew from week to week just where the section might be .
"Nevertheless , the writer has never experienced such spontaneity of discussion after film showings ."
"In fact , they often revamped their social activities to include class members previously unknown ."
"In the main , this course took the following directional high roads ."
"In short , it was centered around learning how to develop a more sensitive empathy ."
"As an example of this last facet , there were some lengthy discussions centered around bereavement ."
These were often carefully written out with a great deal of thought behind them .
Both sexes reported that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage were extremely enlightening .
This was probably much more meaningful because all the women in the class emphasized it time and again .
Perhaps this was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent .
This was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action .
Individual differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to controlled Kohnstamm situations were found among the subjects used in the study .
At no time was it implied by the experimenter that the subject's initial reaction was deviant .
The subjects were only given information about other possibilities of `` normal '' reaction .
These subjects implied that they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried .
"After two drinks containing alcohol , her arm flew upward very freely ."
They explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factors .
Another said that her arm did not go up at first `` because I wouldn't let it ; ;
She explained nonreactivity of others by saying that they were `` not letting themselves relax '' .
but rather that they could be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation .
"However , she was able to relax and yield to the moment ."
It is our hypothesis that Kohnstamm-positive subjects are less hesitant about relinquishing control than are Kohnstamm-negative subjects ; ;
that they can give up their control and allow themselves to be reactors rather than actors .
The Kohnstamm-positive subjects seemed to be freer to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible in the external world .
This occurred in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going downhill .
"They were able to experience at first , in terms of past conventionality ."
It might be postulated that these subjects are unduly afraid of being wrong ; ;
that they perceive new internal and environmental situations as `` threatening '' until they are tested and proved otherwise .
An objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data .
Equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from upper-lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods .
Over-achievers were at least one standard deviation above the regression line in their school system .
It was assumed that the sampling procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables under investigation .
The low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively unconcerned about such matters .
But she cleans it up very well when I remind her '' .
"Castaneda , et al revised the Taylor Anxiety Scale for use with children ."
The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity .
"The two ratings yield a correlation of , which is not significantly different from zero ; ;"
The issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later .
"In establishing criterion measurements , it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself ."
"The predicted interaction effect should , if potent , extend its influence over all academic achievement ."
The battery median grade-equivalent was used in data analysis in this study .
The Wechsler Intelligence Scale For Children was administered to each sample third-grade child by a clinical worker .
"therefore , in the investigation of the present hypothesis , it was necessary to control this factor ."
The criterion score used in the statistical analysis is an index of over- or under-achievement .
No significant difference was found in achievement between high and low compulsive children within the unstructured school .
Indeed their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference was not significant .
Possibly their compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure .
"As shown earlier , the highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorizing of simple elements ."
Success reduces the prospect of threat and his powers of discrimination are improved .
Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals .
"Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals ."
For example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying .
"Each person was to enter the testing room , carrying a suitcase of samples ."
Each salesman was to read a sheet containing a description of the product .
"In the testing room he was to make , successively , three presentations to three different people ."
"In the testing room , three of the veteran salesmen served as antagonists ."
"The antagonists came in , one at a time , and did not see or hear the other presentations ."
"After each presentation , the antagonist wrote his judgment of the salesmen ; ;"
Ten salesmen were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon .
The batting average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three .
"They were , in a sense , `` tried out '' in realistic situations ."
She was hired and was found to be entirely satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day .
Some cases in evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure .
"However , he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position ."
"Turnover rates of personnel went up , production dropped , and morale was visibly reduced ."
"One by one , these errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors ."
"After the diagnosing , he left the course , convinced that it could do him no good ."
We may say that his problem was diagnosed but that he refused treatment .
The engineer turned works manager had a particular view of life -- and refused to change it .
On playing some typical situations before a jury of his peers he showed some characteristics rated as unsatisfactory .
On being criticized for his arbitrary behavior -- he answered : `` I have to make decisions .
"In short , as frequently happens in analyses , the individual feels threatened and defends himself ."
"However , in this case the district manager was led to see the errors of his ways ."
The necessary step between diagnosis and training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms .
"How this was accomplished may be described , since this sometimes is a crucial problem ."
"These errors were then collected and written on a blackboard , condensing similar ideas ."
To accept the validity of the judgments of others is the second step .
To practice new procedures under guided supervision and with constant feedback is the fourth step .
To use these new ways in daily life is the last step .
"Observers can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior , and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion ."
the objective of this chapter is to clarify the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts .
"In addition , the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will be reviewed ."
The reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are twofold .
"Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; ;"
"and when I replied in this spirit , she corroborated my hunch ."
"It then occurred to me to ask , `` Is that what that woman told you '' ? ?"
it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she hated that woman inside her .
Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype -- a `` How are you now '' ? ?
", the patient replied , `` Both , Dearie -- two in one '' ."
"To a much less full extent , the hebephrenic person's belching or flatus has a comparable communicative function ; ;"
"Of such hidden meanings the patient himself is , more often than not , entirely unaware ."
The logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file .
Implementation of the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis .
We suggest the application of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem .
We accomplish this by compiling a list of text forms as text is read by the computer .
Dictionary forms found to match forms in the text list are marked .
A location in the computer store is also named for each marked form ; ;
A more detailed description of dictionary operations -- text lookup and dictionary modification -- gives a clearer picture .
"Text lookup , as we will describe it , consists of three steps ."
cells in the X-region and Y region are reserved as information cells for text forms .
"The form itself is stored in the next available cells of the W-region , beginning in cell Af ."
The address Af and the number of cells required to store the form are written in Af ; ;
"When this situation exists , the address Af will equal Af which was produced from Af ."
A third cell can be added by storing the address of another Y-cell in Af ; ;
the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the chain .
"When the information cell for Af has been determined , it is saved as a representation of Af ."
Text reading is terminated when a pre-determined number of forms have been stored in the text-form list .
Each form represented by the dictionary is looked up in the text-form list .
The number of dictionary forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved .
The appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken at that time .
"When a match is found , an entry is made in the table of dictionary usage ."
The first stage of translation after glossary lookup is structural analysis of the input text .
The grammatical descriptions of all forms in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary file .
The order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe .
Each entry that is selected for storage is written into the next available cells of the Aj .
( The address of the information cell is also supplied by the table of dictionary usage .
( Here an entry is a form plus the information that pertains to it .
The former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage .
An extension of the principle would permit entering a grammatical description of each form .
"Thus , one can think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form ."
"( Indeed , the set of endings can be replaced by the name of a set of endings ."
The dictionary system is in no way dependent upon such summarization or designed around it .
"When irregularity and variation prevent summarizing , information is written in complete detail ."
"In sentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here ."
There is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes .
Thus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley's hymns are as follows .
"Is Bill's broken a chair , dominant stress will usually be on the complement a chair ."
but dominant stress will be assigned to broken only in rather exceptional versions of the sentence .
In I know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing ; ;
in one thing I know it will usually be on the predicator know .
In small-town people are very friendly dominant stress will generally be on the complement very friendly ; ;
in who's a linguist ? it will generally be on the complement a linguist .
"Adverbial second complements , however , are likely not to have dominant stress when they terminate sentences ."
"Is George reads the news emotionally , dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct emotionally ."
When prepositional complements are divided as in what are you looking for ? ?
What is new in the context is likely to be made more prominent than what is not .
In I'll go with George dominant stress is probably on George ; ;
the personal pronoun has dominant stress because `` he '' has not been mentioned previously .
In I know one thing dominant stress is likely to go to one rather than to semantically pale thing .
"Often , dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion ."
"Where there is comparison or contrast , dominant stresses normally operate to center attention ."
"Thus when yes , I have is the response to have you finished reading the paper ? ?"
"The stress on have , which here represents have finished reading the paper , is quite strong ."
"In to tell him , of course , to is normally unstressed ."
"But the use of stress in comparison and contrast , for example , can undermine distinctions such as these ."
"Syllables are genuine units , but division of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties ."
Doubt on this point is strongest before /l/ and AAb/ or /r/ .
From the point of view of word formation real might be expected to have two syllables .
"Historically re is the formative that is employed also in republic , and al is the common suffix ."
"Improvement , however , is urgent , and at least three things will be needed ."
This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone .
"Papers like these four , if widely read , will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work ."
"The result has been neglect , fumbling efforts , or superficial treatment ."
Analyses such as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone is impossible and that it is simple .
They will give suggestions that can be worked up into field procedures .
"Good field techniques will not only equip linguists for better work , but also help them overcome negative attitudes ."
"Actually , none of these papers says much directly about field techniques ."
But it is worth pondering that very little has been published on any phase of field techniques in linguistics .
One issue that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystems .
Tone languages use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use .
This may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable .
The problem is to disentangle the linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic features .
But in general the individual variation is a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude .
"With tone , individual differences may be greater than the linguistic contrasts which are superimposed on them ."
A second explanation is suggested by the material described in Rowlands' paper .
Other pairs of phonologic subsystems also interact or overlap in this way ; ;
"for example , duration sometimes figures in both the vowel system and the intonation ."
But no other two phonologic systems are as difficult to disentangle as are tone and intonation in some languages .
"This explanation of tone difficulties , however , does not apply in all languages ."
"Still , even in such languages tone analysis has not been as simple as one might expect ."
There we see a basically simple phonemic system enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic system .
"The phonemic systems which must support these morphophonemic systems , however , are very different ."
Morphophonemic rules may be thought of as joining certain points in the system .
"Tonal morphophonemics , in a common case , can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone ."
"The possibilities are few , and the total number of rules may be considerably greater ."
"A phonemic system can be stated without reference to morphophonemics , but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics ."
The design of orthographies has received much less attention from linguists than the problem deserves .
"In the process , he develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult ."
His orthographic recommendations are no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on the one hand or of superficiality on the other .
Rather he weighs each phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness .
I hope his suggestions are given the consideration they deserve in Kikuyu circles .
"One other paper deals with a phonologic problem : Vowel Harmony In Igbo , by J. Carnochan ."
As a restatement it makes only a small contribution to knowledge of Igbo .
It does show one feature of the system that has not been previously described .
"But it does not , as it claims , demonstrate that this could not be treated by traditional methods ."
This must be considered primarily an amendment and supplement to his early A Short Description Of Item-Categories In Iraqw .
It exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much the same criticisms .
Swadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ; ;
"I , one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley ."
The groups are therefore really non-comparable in content as well as in size .
Or the exception may be due to a particular durability peculiar to the Athabascan verb .
More word class ratios determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the question .
"the three others had to be spread somewhat , and are headed respectively Af ; ;"
This distribution can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart : Af ; ;
"His second conclusion , on semantic word classes , agrees with mine ."
and Gleason presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area .
"These findings , and others which will in time be developed , will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry ."
Why then this urge to include unstable items in his basic list ? ?
It is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible .
It is the hope of attaining a list of items of universal occurrence .
But it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is a snare .
"but the nearer it comes to attaining universality , the less significant will it be linguistically ."
The most important quality of the meanings is that they should be as definable as possible .
"In proportion as meanings are concrete , we can better rely on their being insulated and distinctive ."
"They isolate out easily , naturally , and unambiguously from the continuum of nature and existence ; ;"
and they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities .
And he has proclaimed greater or less affiliation between all Western hemisphere languages .
Doubtless it was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies .
The long delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia's advantage .
"When this proposal was made , Stalin spoke with stronger emotion than at any other time during the Conference ."
"The issue was left in abeyance , presumably for the peace conference ."
Of more importance to the West than Poland's boundaries was the character of her government .
More time was spent in trying to marry these incompatibles than over any subject discussed at Yalta .
All `` democratic and anti-Nazi parties '' were to have the right to campaign .
"It was a matter of principle with Churchill , since Britain had declared war in behalf of Poland ."
"Throughout history , Poland has been the corridor through which the enemy has passed into Russia ."
"Twice in the last thirty years our enemies , the Germans , have passed through this corridor ."
"It is necessary that Poland should be free , independent in power ."
Byrnes says that invariably thereafter the Soviets used the same security argument to justify their course in Poland .
Other similar affirmations in the Declaration on Liberated Europe seemed to assure democratic institutions on the Western model .
We had entertained exaggerated ideas about our victory automatically establishing our system throughout the world .
"This is a penetrating description of our post-war illusion , which applied to other areas than East Europe ."
Yet actually `` the image corresponded in no way to the actualities of the post-war world .
Here is the best short explanation of the origins of the Cold War that has been written .
While the Cold War raged it was easy to blame it all on Yalta .
When the Yalta Papers were finally published with great fanfare they had revealed no betrayal by anyone .
"First is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion ."
Preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes .
Considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach .
Elections have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence .
Despite the internal and international crises that harassed Morocco the elections remained a central issue .
To minimize the chances of repeating the Balafrej debacle the Ibrahim government was formed .
Those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process .
The local Istiqlal and U.M.C.I.A. offices did not campaign and lost heavily .
"The U.N.F.P. learned that its urban organization , which depends heavily on U.M.T. support , was most effective ."
A second major point of this essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections .
The sine qua non of the elections was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure .
There were liberal provisions for dispensation where documents or records were lacking .
"The police were disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized citizens , criminals and those punished for Protectorate activities ."
"Some vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities ."
"The initiative , administration and control remain primarily with the local school districts ."
"Even the states remain primarily in an assisting role , providing leadership and teacher training ."
"Today , Federal funds account for only one-fifth of the nation's expenditures for vocational education ."
National defense considerations have been the major reason behind most Federal training expenditures in recent decades .
No comparable measures are available of enrollments and expenditures for private vocational education training .
"There are a great number and variety of private commercial schools , trade schools and technical schools ."
"In addition , many large corporations operate their own formal training programs ."
"Most skilled industrial workers , nevertheless , still acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions ."
An extension of this program into the other distressed areas should be undertaken .
Planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained workers .
"Furthermore , there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys ."
"Local jobs can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical ."
The U. S. Office of Education continues to stress local surveys rather than national surveys .
This procedure is extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history of declining employment .
"Moreover , the current information on what types of training are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary ."
Much of the available information comes not from the Federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states .
A related question is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided .
Local school districts are hard pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training .
Programs usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand it .
Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities .
A program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor .
"This would heighten possibilities for part-time cooperative , on-the-job and extension training ."
Personal financial assistance would enable more emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual .
His aptitudes and preferences could be given more weight in selecting the proper training .
"But briefly , the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences ."
Then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance .
But there is no positive and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense .
"After all , too much does not happen too suddenly , nor does very little take long ."
Correlations have been worked up between the loading of freight cars and the course of stock price .
"The theory behind this is , of course , fundamentalist in character ."
Much of this goes on in offices high up in Wall Street's lofty wind-swept towers .
"They plot the open interest curves , rainfall curves , and they even divide Democratic congressmen by Republican congressmen ."
"All these things and countless more enter into their calculations , and yet , the enchanting index remains non-forthcoming ."
"Not , at any rate , in the fuller sense of the word ."
"But whereas civilized men no longer pursue the fountain , they never abandoned their pursuit of the enchanting index ."
"This results in a separate record being made , distinguishing these trades from the overall volume of trading ."
Odd-lot index observers then make graphs of the data according to their particular statistical recipe .
"The data is now interpreted in conjunction with a price chart , usually of a popular stock average ."
This warns the chartist that the formation in progress is quite likely to be a top .
"Obviously someone has to sell in order for someone to buy , and vice versa ."
Strong hands differ from `` weak hands '' in that their operations are the primary movers .
They are able to sit more patiently with what they have bought .
"But after all , can anyone imagine a market wherein the reverse of these things were true ? ?"
How much and how many profits could a majority take out of the losses of a few ? ?
"It has to , by virtue of the very dictionary definition of the word `` few '' ."
"Though the methods of deciding may be profound and diverse , the possible conclusions remain but two ."
Nineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business activity .
The tendency for general business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident .
Our efforts to overcome the lead of the Russians in space are bound to mean accelerated Federal spending .
"However , the impact of a rising rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerated ."
This is an area in which there is still a large backlog of demand .
This is not to say that the level of consumer expenditures will not continue to rise in the Sixties .
"For the purposes of setting the product price , the industry behaves as a single entity ."
"In wage negotiations , the industry bargains as a unit with a single union ."
The manner in which this is shared among firms is taken as given .
( We abstract here from technological progress and assume that prices of all other products change proportionately .
"The foreign-entry-limit price would be approached more rapidly , since domestic wage-rates do not enter foreign costs directly ."
"As a strike continues , these parties increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement ."
They become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage bargain would entail .
"The level of this average cost is determined by factor prices , technology , and so forth ."
"Changes in the basic wage rate are cost-raising , and they constitute an argument for raising prices ."
we do so by disproving the presumption on which it is based .
It is convenient to assume that the union-industry contract is of one year's duration .
The Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow .
"second , it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared ."
It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions .
More emphasis was put upon the fact that international law was the law of `` civilized nations '' ; ;
A number of other nineteenth-century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law of nations into international law ; ;
No longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine what he ought to do ; ;
his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action .
"To appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth-century philosophy ."
he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be .
Hidden behind Hegelian abstractions were more practical reasons for a changing jurisprudence .
"Related to , but distinguishable from , nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another ."
Law was seen as an emanation of the `` sovereign will '' .
"However , the sovereign was not Hobbes' absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of Austin ."
"Man , through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom , was master of his destiny ."
"The theory did not require , though it unfortunately might acquire , a Hegelian mystique ."
It was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions of popular government .
it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who wielded public authority .
Particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society .
that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with .
"Indeed , contract was the dominant legal theme of the century , the touchstone of the free society ."
business organization -- the corporation -- was analyzed in contractual terms ; ;
"trade was based on freedom of contract , and money was lent and borrowed on contractual terms ; ;"
It is not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in terms of contract .
One result was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the law of nations .
A flood of federal lower court injunctions seriously impeded the processes of local government .
Three years later similar restraints were imposed upon injunctions against collection of state taxes .
"Meanwhile , the Supreme Court , like Congress , showed misgivings concerning this aspect of government by injunction ."
The commission had issued an administrative order which was challenged as discriminatory against Negroes .
"The railroad , claiming deprivation of property without due process of law , sought injunctive relief ."
"Justices Frankfurter and Jackson concurred in the Court's result , for they found no merit in the railroad's claim ."
A most revealing recent case is Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills .
it does not establish any law ( rights ) for the federal judges to enforce .
How can judges exercise jurisdiction to enforce national rights when Congress has created none ? ?
This would satisfy what presumably was Congress' major purpose -- the suability of unions .
It would also leave intact the states' traditional authority in the realm of contract law .
) Here again Mr. Justice Frankfurter could not lightly accept the principle of wholesale judicial legislation .
And let it do its own lawmaking and not leave that to federal judges .
There is a common problem behind most of these federal question and diversity cases .
Congress has not clearly defined the bounds between state and federal court competence .
"With few exceptions , Congress has not given federal courts exclusive authority to enforce rights arising under federal law ."
"The result , of course , would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in different states ."
We consider here only a few of many problems involved in this crucial federal-state relationship .
"A similar canon applies to those who press state claims in federal tribunals , e.g. , in diversity cases ."
In other words the burden of pleading clearly rested upon the pleader by state law .
"Here , as in the Byrd case , another element of state procedure was subsumed to federal judge-made law ."
Terminiello v. Chicago involved a conviction for disorderly conduct under a local ordinance .
Such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone ; ;
it would certainly violate the intention of Congress as expressed in the Committee Report ; ;
"Neither reason , said the Court , applied to the case at hand ; ;"
"furthermore , Congress could not be presumed to have intended to obstruct mergers approved by the states ."
Exceptions are often classified as transfers by `` operation of law '' .
"In substance , said the Court , there was no transfer of equitable title ."
"The former proof seems applicable to a statutory merger or consolidation , the latter to a contractual acquisition ."
"The Ruling would not , however , apply to an acquisition of assets for cash ."
The Ruling suggests also that it applies to either a statutory or contractual reorganization .
The cases have allowed transfer of claims if beneficial ownership is not changed .
In these circumstances the possibility of multiple or conflicting claims is exceedingly remote .
The successor corporations have been held entitled to sue on such claims .
This carryover right has a number of things in common with a net operating loss carryover .
It is an averaging device intended to ease the tax burden of fluctuating income ; ;
There is the danger that the questions will mean different things to different respondents .
The research team was very mindful of these dangers and limitations of a mail questionnaire .
"Under the circumstances , however , the team considered it would provide the most useful information at this point ."
Respondents' preferences regarding the methods of awarding defense contracts ( Part G of the questionnaire )
"The questionnaire also stated that , in any event , all replies would be treated confidentially ."
The research team prepared and then revised the questionnaire over a period of six months .
The method of compiling the AIA and TR lists will be described later .
The objective of the study was to determine the opinions and practices of small firms selling to defense programs .
The firms to receive the questionnaires were selected with this objective in mind .
The primary consideration in the compilation of this list was convenience in discussing the questionnaire with company officers .
These names were secured from member companies by the Association from the forty-four sources listed in Appendix Aj .
"Where possible , the name of an executive was supplied along with the company name and address ."
The forty-four lists supplied by the AIA member companies were merged and duplicate names were eliminated .
There was further elimination of all companies that were not accompanied by the name of a responsible company executive .
The third list was selected by the research team on a random basis from the Thomas Register .
The fact that AIA lists might not have been selected on a random basis .
Fifty-seven returns could not be used because they were incomplete or received too late to be processed .
"All responses , except comments , were numerically coded to permit use of data-processing equipment ."
The methods and results of this comparative analysis are described in Appendix Aj .
The vast Central Valley of California is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world .
"It is not a pleasant or easy position , but one we have endeavored to maintain ."
"Inevitably , one side was pleased and the other displeased , regardless of how we ruled ."
Often the displeased parties interpreted our decision as implying favoritism toward the other .
"For a number of years , there have been sporadic attempts in California to organize farm workers ."
"To date , at least , the strategy of the AWOC has been selective ; ;"
"Primarily , we became involved in these disputes because of our referral obligations under our farm placement program ."
"Infrequently do we think of it as a living , continuing , operating control over the system ."
"However , when labor disputes arise , its provisions come clearly into play ."
"In analyzing this regulation , let us take the last sentence first ."
"Assume , for example , a situation where a farm has a packing shed and fields ."
It is the first part of the Regulation that is currently at issue .
"The court issued a temporary restraining order , directing us to resume referrals ."
"It accordingly refused to assume jurisdiction , whereupon the California Superior Court made the restraining order permanent ."
"Under that order , we have continued referring workers to the ranch ."
"I cannot accept that view , either as a lawyer or as an administrator ."
"First , let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved ."
"It is conclusive , unless appealed , only upon the particular parties to the particular action which was heard ."
"It is not binding upon another Superior Court , which could rule to the contrary ."
Here the problem is essentially one of defining the word `` filling '' .
"Because of the uncertainty of this definition , I solicited the interpretation of the Secretary of Labor ."
He has advised me that the narrower interpretation is the proper one ; ;
"After they have developed concepts , they are free from the necessity of manipulating objects ; ;"
One experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between the eleventh and twelfth years .
Many studies indicate that elementary-school children's interests cover the whole field of science ; ;
that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and events ; ;
and that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and broaden .
The following generalizations about the emotional characteristics of elementary-school children may be helpful .
"as the influence of learning and environment are felt , emotional behavior becomes individualized ."
The following summary will give the student some idea about the social characteristics of elementary-school children ; ;
In late childhood the influence of the group on the social behavior of the child continues to increase ; ;
"In later childhood , an interest in team games replaces individual play ; ;"
"During early childhood boys tease and bully , on the average , more than girls ; ;"
those who feel inferior or insecure engage in these activities more than do well-adjusted children .
"During late childhood boys like to tease , jostle , and talk smart to girls ; ;"
"By the time pupils reach the sixth grade , their ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed ; ;"
"Between the ages of two and four years , negativism or resistance to adult authority is noticeable ; ;"
The elementary-school child grows gradually in his ability to work in groups .
"he wants to be with people , but he hasn't yet learned to cooperate ."
Some are failing to achieve as much as their ability would permit ; ;
others never seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom .
These children have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults who did not understand .
"These maladjustments in turn inhibit learning , and a vicious cycle is completed ."
"They may be caused by poor health habits , such as faulty eating and sleeping habits ."
They may be related to mental immaturity or lack of aptitude for certain types of school work .
The curriculum may be too difficult for some and too easy for others .
"Teaching methods , learning materials , and promotion policies may inhibit learning and lead to maladjustments for some children ."
"Unwholesome family relations , broken homes , and undesirable community influences may also be contributing factors ."
This is only a minimum list of the factors that inhibit learning and contribute to maladjustment among children .
"Moreover , these conditions do not influence all children in the same manner ."
"He can be expected , however , to examine and interpret the information already available ; ;"
to refine and extend his own techniques for studying individual children ; ;
This section deals with some of the sources of information that can be tapped by the classroom teacher ; ;
Most school systems today maintain a system of cumulative records of pupils .
During summer vacation periods these records are stored in the office of the principal .
Only the teacher and other professional personnel are permitted to see or use these records .
The Report together with other information suggests that desegregation in the schools is slow .
"Elementary school desegregation came to Owen and Union Counties , which already had high school desegregation ."
"thus , county school board and Federal court joined hands here to promote school desegregation ."
Additional school desegregation in Tennessee resulted from a court order opening a school serving children of military personnel .
In West Virginia the number of white and Negro children attending the same school has increased almost twofold .
"As in Maryland , a District court has approved an official plan of school desegregation in Delaware ."
The Third Circuit Court of Appeals is reviewing an appeal from the plan .
In Virginia court orders led to desegregation in Charlottesville and Floyd Counties .
"Desegregation in Pulaski County is pending because of court order , although date of admission is not yet determined ."
"From the Summary Report before us at this Conference , a number of problems are apparent ."
They vex us and perplex us but generally do not divide us like the issues which follow the problems .
I believe we all want more schools where white and Negro together can and do attend .
I believe we all want no child denied admission to a school on account of his color .
"How to achieve this objective is a problem , but we are not divided on what we want ."
"Third , how can we insure a systematic and continuing group relations education in the schools ? ?"
"This is a problem , but we are not divided over its importance or by its existence ."
Can we help children adjust to `` images of other children '' when the latter are not actually present .
We can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated situation .
The earlier part of my statement deals with the court orders that resulted in desegregation .
Is the requirement that the plaintiff be a person actually denied admission to a school a sound requirement ? ?
Withholding of funds to schools that deny children on account of race .
This is softer than earlier Powell amendments which would have denied funds to all segregated school districts .
"The Federal funds limitation enlists the support of many , the opposition of quite a few ."
"Should a political subdivision , state or county or municipality , be required to furnish public education ? ?"
Is public education in this American democracy of such importance that no child should be denied public education ? ?
"Or is this subject a matter of self-determination , a matter of states rights or county rights ? ?"
"If people don't want to provide public education , should they be forced to do so ? ?"
Or must it become law by amendment of the United States Constitution ? ?
We actually have two issues in this question -- goal and method .
Should the government directly provide education for the children who want public education ? ?
The next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational policy-makers .
"On the whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way ."
Seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn .
In situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education .
There is currently a major controversy of public education in which group interests and values are heavily engaged .
In this case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial groups rather than social-class groups .
"Thus , the white middle and lower classes are arrayed against the Negro middle and lower classes ."
"They are mostly upper-middle- and lower-middle-class people , with a few in the upper class ."
Their own experience in the social system influences their work and attitudes as teachers .
"that is , they are likely to favor a kind of education that has vocational-advancement value ."
Educational policies are formed by several groups who are officially or unofficially appointed to act in the public interest .
"Legislators are one such group , and state legislators have major responsibility for educational legislation ."
"Generally these commissions work earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society , as they conceive it ."
"Both Commissions consisted of upper-middle- and upper-class people , who attempted to act in the public interest ."
"They are predominantly middle- and upper-class people , and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes of those classes ."
They may be unaware of the existence of lower-class values and consequently fail to take them into account .
They think of themselves as trustees for the entire society and try to serve the entire society .
Educational policy in the United States has as an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural opportunity .
This leads to efforts at exclusiveness through private schools and to the maintenance of social stratification in the schools .
Both of these purposes exist side by side without much overt conflict under present conditions .
Fifty years ago the general raising of the school-leaving age to sixteen was an example of this movement .
The gains in educational opportunity during the past decade have taken place largely in the publicly supported institutions .
"Here , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma ."
"For more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses ."
Suffice it to say that the usefulness of the latter apportionment is questionable .
"Other services will show different rates of return , some probably much lower and some higher ."
"Like primitive numbers in mathematics , the entire axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth ."
But what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces the idea of physical models ? ?
The simple pragmatic success of the sociology of small groups needs to be questioned .
The mere exploration of the unconscious ground of present-day sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical and logical investigation .
A parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation between perceptions experientially received and conceptions logically formed .
Philosophy can supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection of socially viable categories .
This involves a sifting of the empirical and rational elements entering into each social science statement .
"But contrary to Whitehead , philosophy is not a synonym for Plato ."
Metaphysics is no longer a direct grappling with nature as it was in antiquity .
It is not positivism which has isolated metaphysics from reality by distinguishing between description and prescription .
It is simply revealing the state to which metaphysical thinking has fallen during this century .
"Consider the traditional `` four fields '' of philosophy : logic , ethics , epistemology and esthetics ."
But the forceful presentation of new issues for the sciences to work on is itself a monumental task .
This is simply a confession of intellectual sterility spruced up to look virtuous .
for this division is but an abstract representation of the social struggle between mysticism and science .
"Philosophic systems , by the very nature of their completeness , are overthrown by rival systems ."
philosophic analysis of the assumptions and presumptions of the social sciences ; ;
and philosophy as a guide to possible integration of supposedly disparate sociological investigations .
Do societies develop according to cosmic patterns or are they subject only to the free choice of individuals ? ?
Does society really exist as an entity over and above the agglomeration of men ? ?
Such pseudo-questions assume that answers of concrete significance can be supplied to statements involving undefined universals .
"Men have always lived in a tentative world , and in suspension of ultimate judgments where and when necessary ."
Uncertainty overcoming itself is the precondition of the quest for new and more precise information about the world .
Without such uncertainty we are left with a set of dogmas and myths .
"The functional interplay of philosophy and science should , as a minimum , guarantee a meaningful option to myth-making ."
A degree of indefiniteness is a salutary condition for the growth of science .
"What were they to do , then , with these awkward judgments of value ? ?"
It appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only .
It has been said of John Stuart Mill that he wrote so clearly that he could be found out .
"Let us work through an example , and the simpler and commoner the better ."
We come upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the brutal traps in common use .
The positivist tells us that when we say this we are only expressing our present emotion .
Now that this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows .
The first argument is thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference .
"And our question is , is such an implication consistent with what we meant ? ?"
"So far as I can see , there is only one way out for the positivist ."
He holds that goodness and badness lie in feelings of approval or disapproval .
"I come now to a third argument , which again is very simple ."
the positivists are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling .
But suppose that a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement again .
It is as empty as the word `` Hurrah '' would be when there was no enthusiasm behind it .
but on the theory before us such a belief would not make sense .
"In his novel The House Of The Dead , Dostoevsky tells of his experiences in a Siberian prison camp ."
There is therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting .
"But if that is true , why is any attitude more fitting than any other ? ?"
"Would condemnation be fitting if , independently of the condemnation , there were nothing bad to condemn ? ?"
To greet them with repulsion would turn what before was neutral into something bad ; ;
This resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also .
We do not arrive at spatial images by means of the sense of touch by itself .
"that is , there is , in the true sense , only a visual space '' ."
This is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel .
"The answer the authors give to it , therefore , is of supreme importance ."
"First of all , what is their evidence that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally undamaged ? ?"
"that is , he was unaware what kind of objects they were or what their use was ."
"In what ways , then , did the patient's psychical blindness manifest itself ? ?"
"and , therefore , he could not recognize even long-familiar things upon seeing them again ."
The patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery at all ; ;
and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate him .
he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he had no visual memory at all .
and this he could do only by going over its mass with the tracing procedure .
"Dice , for example , he inferred from black dots on a white surface ."
-- has now been raised in the reader's mind and in the following form .
"How , then , do the kinesthetic sensations function in all this ? ?"
To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment .
"At the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ;"
their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line .
"Throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm , severe serenity displays itself ."
The general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant degree .
In this process the Minoan-Mycenaean inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected ; ;
"Attica , though important , was not the only teacher of this age ."
These local variations were to become ever sharper in the next century and a half .
"Everywhere within the common pattern , however , one finds local diversity ; ;"
"Further we cannot go , for the Dark ages deserve their name ."
"Throughout the Dark ages , it is clear , the Greek world had been developing slowly but consistently ."
"The pace could now be accelerated , for the inhabitants of the Aegean stood on firm ground ."
but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more unmistakably some of the lines of change .
"For this period , as for earlier centuries , pottery remains the most secure source ; ;"
Figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in Greece ; ;
but both were among the last products of a phase which was ending .
the gods who protected the Greek countryside were only now putting on their sharply anthropomorphic dress .
Many potters clung to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted with radically new ideas ; ;
for the developments in these areas make sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself .
The antecedents of Dipylon vases and of the Iliad lie in the Aegean past .
the pottery of the first half of the eighth century is commonly called Ripe Geometric .
"The vases which resulted had different shapes , far more complex decoration , and a larger sense of style ."
In earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos .
They had had to work on very simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses .
"it was time to take bigger steps , to venture on experiments ."
In these respects the vases of the early eighth century represent a culmination of earlier lines of progress .
Painters left less and less of a vase in a plain dark color ; ;
"Thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him ."
"Arriving at daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender ."
It was nearly sundown before they finished the business with Beall and began riding down the stream .
They stayed with a rancher Friday night and by eleven o'clock Saturday morning passed the old Garnett Lee ranch .
"Grabbing his Winchester from its sheath , Cook prepared to fight from behind the arroyo bank ."
"At a very shallow place , two Mexicans rushed into the open for a shot ."
"Just before leaving the arroyo where he was partially concealed , he did hear shots down at the house ."
"During the following week , six tons of hay belonging to one rancher were burned ; ;"
Increasing threats on his life finally convinced Cook that he should leave New Mexico .
"nothing accomplished , and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to be an absolute farce '' ."
"As he pushed open the door he fell on his face , one of his comrades pulling him inside ."
Several slugs fired into the bed jerked aside the blanket to reveal an apparently lifeless hand .
"Shot six or eight times the body was draped with Russell's pistol , belt , and cartridges ."
"If not , how long to order and what is the price '' ? ?"
The plant was located west of the Battenkill and south of the location of the former electric light plant .
It has given considerable trouble at times and empties right into the Battenkill .
The sewer on Bonnet Street was constructed when there were only a few houses on the street .
No figures were submitted with the report and no action was taken on it by the town .
A message of less than fifteen words to Bennington cost twenty-five cents .
The Manchester Journal commented editorially on the surprising amount of local telegraphic business .
"Besides being most convenient , the line `` soon proved a good investment for the owners '' ."
"During the summers , Towsley often needed the assistance of a company operator ."
This boosted local telegraph business and Manchester basked in all the free advertising .
"During summers , business was so brisk that Mrs. Wilcox had two assistants and a messenger ."
This was extended the following year to include the railroad station agent's office and Thayer's Hotel at Factory Point .
A small single switchboard was installed in the Village over Woodcock's hardware store ( later E. H. Hemenway's ) .
More aerial and underground equipment was installed as well as office improvements to take care of the expanding business .
This was working by the end of August and giving satisfactory service .
"Nothing came of it , perhaps due to lack of opportunity for water storage ."
It was at the end of the sidewalk in front of the Dellwood Cemetery cottage .
Utopia is still widely read because in a sense More stood on the margin of modernity .
More stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone -- because he wrote Utopia .
Can we discover what it is in Utopia that has evoked this response ? ?
we want to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has ; ;
But it is an answer which opens the door wide to an onrush of objections and denials .
"We find it in Plato's Republic , and in Utopia More acknowledges his debt to that book ."
We find it in the later Stoic conception of man's natural condition which included the community of all possessions .
We will achieve a more vivid sense of what it is by realizing what it is not .
In Plato's Republic communism is -- to speak anachronistically -- a communism of Janissaries .
In More's Utopia communism is not a means of separating out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass .
And in the economy of the book it is not peripheral but central .
"The concern of Utopia is with the optimo reipublicae statu , the best ordering of a civil society ; ;"
The apostolic community was literally an elite : chosen by Christ himself .
In that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the Fall of Man .
"When we give the necessities of life to the poor , we restore to them what is already theirs ."
We should think of it more as an act of justice than compassion '' .
Neither from one of these conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced .
it is one of the very few new things in Utopia ; ;
most of the rest is medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism .
Consider the features of Utopian communism : generous public provision for the infirm ; ;
"democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests , meals taken publicly in common refectories ; ;"
"Although Rhode Islanders were preparing for the state elections , they watched John Brown's trial with extreme interest ."
The editor's main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted .
In the eastern section of the state the newspapers' reaction to Brown's trial and sentence were basically identical .
There was no doubt as to the control the Republican party exercised throughout the state .
The American Republicans and the Republicans both nominated Lieutenant-Governor Turner for governor .
Most attempts to develop any sympathy for Brown and his actions found an unresponsive audience in Rhode Island .
The Warren Telegraph stated that many of Rev. Trafton's remarks were inappropriate and savored strongly of radicalism and fanaticism .
He further called upon the people of Providence to rebuke the meeting and avoid disgrace .
"Seated on the platform were Amos C. Barstow , ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove manufacturer ; ;"
"Although admitting Brown's guilt on legal grounds , Day said that , `` Brown is no common criminal ; ;"
Woodbury's remarks were applauded by a portion of the audience several times and once there was hissing .
By this time large numbers of the audience had left the hall .
"instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture ."
"But here again , the surface-declaring device both overshoots and falls short of its aim ."
"And the surface is driven back , in its very surfaceness , only by this contrast ."
"And the same thing , more or less , can be said of the contents of Picasso's first collage ."
"In order to be saved , plasticity had had to be isolated ; ;"
( This provides whatever real justification there is for the talk about `` reality '' .
"Left in their previous atom-like smallness , they would have cut away too abruptly into depth ; ;"
"Analytical Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; ;"
"As it affects the city's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; ;"
it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services .
City planners do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might .
"Meanwhile , the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance ."
It is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities .
The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his plant site .
"They are all suburban plants , relying on the roads to keep them supplied with workers ."
"They can even be rather grand , like Edward Land's monument to the astonishing success of Polaroid ."
"While the factories were always the center of the labor market , they were often on the city's periphery ."
Even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt's motel has been relatively painless ; ;
"Department stores congregated in the `` one hundred per cent location '' , where all the transit lines converged ."
"In most discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially inflated ."
"Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown ."
`` How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm '' ? ?
Was a question that had to be asked long before they saw Paree .
"He left at his death sketches , drawn to scale , for the rest of the circle ."
When Costaggini had used up all the sketches thirty-six feet of empty frieze were left over .
"These may be consulted in the office of the Architect of the Capitol , or the Library of Congress ."
"Cartoons were drawn full size , after sketches had been made to satisfy all the authorities ."
"Nothing could be seen from the floor , but by moving around the gallery one could get glimpses ; ;"
"That is , they used opaque color throughout , getting solid highlights with active lime white ."
This brown is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint .
I am told that a mortar longer slaked might have remained longer in condition for painting .
"It was obvious that to match Brumidi , white must be mixed with all but the darkest tones ."
"Other pigments were mostly raw umber , some burnt umber , and a little yellow ochre ."
The use of `` secco '' we tried to restrict to covering joints .
Later Brumidi and Costaggini will be seen coping with this same problem .
"We made it by Doerner's recipe , five parts thoroughly washed cheese curd to one of lime putty ; ;"
"ground together they made a strong adhesive , which became waterproof in drying ."
"where , of Costaggini , only some foliage has been washed , at the point where his work stopped ."
Costaggini said it was Brumidi's fault in not providing enough material to fill the circle .
One sees Costaggini's rendering of the same figure more than thirty feet away .
A valve in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower .
"One man sprayed , with a sponge in hand to check excess wetting ."
No soap or other cleaning agent was used that might bring in unwanted chemical reactions .
We were greatly helped by there being no traces of former restoring .
"Apparently not more than dusting had ever been done , and not much of that ."
Those whom I wish to address with this letter are for the most part unknown to me .
"As American artists , it was natural that we would want to meet as many Soviet artists as possible ."
This letter might not have been necessary had our efforts to meet and talk with you been more successful .
There should be no reason to misinterpret or ignore the intent of this letter .
That which I found most profound and most disturbing appeared to evoke a curiously muted reaction .
"Personal predispositions tend to blunt the ear and , in turn , the voice as well ."
I cannot be content with the anecdotal small talk of a somewhat unusual travelogue .
they are small in number and their contribution is not immediately decisive in everyday life .
The other had assumed the right to explore the equally uncharted space of the human spirit .
The flowers on his grave attested to the fact that he as well was somebody's hero .
A struggle that is being waged all over the world in the half-light of disinterest .
I could not bring myself to answer that `` some of my best friends are non-propagating mules '' .
This kind of reasoning and logic takes a little time to get used to .
Theories of the behavior pattern of population masses were compared to scientific discoveries concerning the motion-pattern of gaseous masses .
She retreated by leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting might well terminate right then and there .
To have one's intentions deliberately or unintentionally misunderstood is always a waste of time .
"Until our Moscow experience , I had not considered it necessary to prepare any argument formally or informally ."
Artists simply do not talk to each other in that fashion ; ;
"and , furthermore , I could not presume the implication that I spoke for American artists as a group ."
The following is a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artists in Leningrad :
Your present history is equally admirable for its industrial and scientific achievements .
Its scope is as broad as the question : What does it mean to live in modern society ? ?
"That could be easily done , but there is little reason in it ."
There are more substantial criticisms to be made of Fromm's account of capitalist civilization .
It is worthwhile to recall that Fromm's treatment has both descriptive and normative aspects .
Almost no empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation .
"Despite its rather long intellectual history , alienation is still a promising hypothesis and not a verified theory ."
What is its incidence among the various classes and subgroups of the population ? ?
"Taking alienation as a dependent variable , with what socio-structural factors is it most highly associated ? ?"
"Considered as an independent variable , how does it affect behavior in various sectors of life ? ?"
I am not suggesting that Fromm ought to do this kind of work .
Nor do I think that alienation is nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual .
"Until such evidence appears , we must make do with the evidence we have ."
"Moreover , the conclusions he draws from the findings are not always the only ones possible ."
Fromm says these data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment are widespread .
"That is one way to read the findings , but again there are other ways ."
"`` Are people happy , are they as satisfied , unconsciously , as they believe themselves to be ? ?"
"Considering the nature of man , and the conditions for happiness , this can hardly be so '' ."
The ambiguities suggested above stem from a more basic difficulty in Fromm's style of thought .
"Sometimes he uses it as a subjective , descriptive term , and sometimes as an objective , diagnostic one ."
The failure to keep these two usages distinct presents hazards to the reader .
It also permits Fromm to do some dubious things with empirical findings .
"( He , in effect , does say this in his discussion of the pseudo-happiness of the automaton conformist ."
It is largely a matter of finding passages that suit one's purposes .
"these , almost by definition , are spokesmen for an alienated ideology ."
One such instance has already been presented : his use of alienation .
The only other one I shall mention here is his use of the term capitalism .
"For Fromm , capitalism is the enemy , the root of all evil ."
Much of this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections .
In this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ;
"Otherwise Mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies for prolonged expressions of emotion -- Boris' first monologue , for example ."
"Even then , the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that the word comes first in importance ."
"Even those who appear in only one or two scenes are full personalities , defined with economical precision ."
it introduces Pimen when he comes before Boris in the last act .
"Here the composer uses a favorite device of his , the intensification of the mood through key relationships ."
The same could be said for the song to which they make their entrance in the final scene .
"Apparently their origin is humble , their approach to life direct and unsophisticated ."
Whatever learning they may have had in their order doesn't disturb them now .
"Missail is the straight man , not very talkative , mild-mannered when he does speak ."
"Varlaam is loud , rowdy , uninhibited in his pleasures and impatient with anyone who is not the same ."
"The phrasing is irregular , and the abrupt key changes have a primitive forcefulness ."
Both monks respond to the guard's challenge with a few phrases of their begging song ; ;
"For the only time in the opera , words are not set according to their natural inflection ; ;"
to do so would have spoiled the dramatic point of the scene .
"Musically and dramatically , Rangoni is as far removed from the conventional monk as Varlaam ."
His speech shows none of the native accent of the Russian characters ; ;
"His personality appears more striking by contrast with Marina , who is -- perhaps purposely -- rather superficially characterized ."
"He addresses Marina with great deference , calling her `` Princess '' at first ; ;"
"This is no assignment for a frivolous girl , she assures him ."
"Coming from a priest , the music sounds as odd as the advice :"
"she is the unattainable beauty , the princess who turns away suitors by the dozen ."
Indignantly she denounces Rangoni for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her .
"Whatever the source of Rangoni's power , Marina is his captive now ; ;"
Mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the extent to which choral scenes propel the action .
One reason for the unique vitality of the chorus is its great variety in expression .
There is a quick change from the plaintive song to a conversational tone .
"`` Hey , Mityukh '' , asks one group , `` what are we shouting about '' ? ?"
"And Mityukh , apparently the intellectual leader of the crowd , replies that he has no notion ."
This is especially striking between Pimen's quiet exit and Grigori's vehement outburst against Boris .
"Though brief , it has a sharp dramatic edge and great poignancy ."
"this is met with scorn by the hearers , who claim that Mityukh is lying or drunk ."
"( Mussorgsky cleverly contrasts the two groups by their orchestral accompaniment , solemn chords or mocking staccatos ."
") There is still more news , Mityukh announces : they have prayed for the soul of the Tsarevich ."
"The dated poems suggest that while Hardy's concern with poetry may have been constant , his production was not ."
"Satires Of Circumstance and Moments Of Vision , coming during his most productive decade , are relatively self-contained ; ;"
These observations about Hardy's productivity tally with the details of his life as we know them .
"The range of the later poetry is considerably narrower , but the number of successful poems is far greater ."
"It is smoother than Hardy usually is , but with the smoothness of anonymity ."
"It is obviously a young man's poem , written out of books and not out of experience ; ;"
"it asserts emotion without evoking it -- that is to say , it is sentimental ."
In the poem we recognize and acknowledge one man's sense of the world ; ;
"if it is somber , it is also precise , and the precision lends authority to the vision ."
"In `` Revulsion '' , on the other hand , the pessimism is a case not proven ; ;"
the poem offers nothing to persuade us of the speaker's right to speak as he does .
These are the poems Hardy wrote after the death of his first wife ; ;
Hardy obviously felt that these poems were peculiarly personal and private ; ;
"The poems are , the epigraph tells us , the `` traces of an ancient flame '' ; ;"
"If the word deliberate means anything , both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves ."
"So as the years passed , I saw them each time in the light of an accelerated personal conflagration ."
The rowdy crowd chilled into stillness and the fluent melody spiraled through it .
"The last time I saw Dylan , his self-destruction had not just passed the limits of rationality ."
Being with him was like being swept away by a torrent of falling stones .
Now Dylan Thomas and Charlie Parker have a great deal more in common than the same disastrous end .
"But this fluent , enchanting utterance had , compared with important artists of the past , relatively little content ."
Neither of them got very far beyond a sort of entranced rapture at his own creativity .
The principal theme of Thomas's poetry was the ambivalence of birth and death -- the pain of blood-stained creation .
"This , of course , is the theme of much art -- perhaps most poetry ."
"It is the theme of Horace , who certainly otherwise bears little resemblance to Parker or Thomas ."
The difference is that Horace accepted his theme with a kind of silken assurance .
I do not believe that this is due to anything especially frightful about their relationship to their own creativity .
Horace's column of imperishable verse shines quietly enough in the lucid air of Augustan Rome .
"Art may have been for him the most enduring , orderly , and noble activity of man ."
Dylan Thomas's verse had to find endurance in a world of burning cities and burning Jews .
"Thomas and Parker have more in common than theme , attitude , life pattern ."
"In the practice of their art , there is an obvious technical resemblance ."
Thomas is a regression from the technical originality and ingenuity of writers like Pierre Reverdy or Apollinaire .
The tonal novelties consist in the introduction of a few chords used in classical music for centuries .
This is exactly what happened in the transition from baroque to rococo music .
It is not a farfetched analogy to say that this is what Thomas did to poetry .
The special syntactical effects of a Rimbaud or an Edith Sitwell -- actually ornaments -- become the main concern .
"The metaphysical conceits , which fascinate the Reactionary Generation still dominant in backwater American colleges , were embroideries ."
This is one difference between Bird and Dylan which should be pointed out .
"Again , contrary to popular belief , there is nothing crazy or frantic about Parker either musically or emotionally ."
His sinuous melody is a sort of naive transcendence of all experience .
"He may have been eccentric in his behavior , but his paintings are as impassive as Persian tiles ."
The insistent talk-aboutiveness of the general environment obtrudes into even the most idyllic poetry .
Thomas certainly wanted to tell people about the ruin and disorder of the world .
Parker and Pollock wanted to substitute a work of art for the world .
"In modern jazz , the saxophone is treated as a woodwind and played with conventional embouchure ."
The main line of development today goes back to Lester Young and by-passes them .
"The point is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays are aberrant , idiosyncratic ."
Nothing looks anything like an Ernst or an Arp but another Ernst or Arp .
Nothing looks less like their work than the happenings of random occasion .
"Once again what has happened is an all-consuming confabulation of the incidentals , the accidents of painting ."
the splashes of light and black which fake drapery in the fashionable imitators of Hals and Sargent .
At its best the abstract expressionists achieve a simple rococo decorative surface .
"A Tiepolo painting , however confabulated , is a universe of tensions in vast depths ."
A Pollock is an object of art -- bijouterie -- disguised only by its great size .
"The great Ashikaga brush painters painted wallpapers , too -- at least portable ones , screens ."
"That such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey , at least , is hard to deny ."
The Anglo-Saxon alliterative line and the Homeric hexameter probably imposed less of a restraint ; ;
Yet certain aids were valuable and quite credibly necessary for reciting long stretches of verse without a pause .
"The Germanic poet had such aids in the kennings , which provided for the difficulties of alliteration ; ;"
"the Homeric poet had epithets , which provided for recurring needs in the hexameter ."
The quest of the historical Homer is likely never to have further success ; ;
no individual word in The Iliad or The Odyssey can be credited to any one man ; ;
It is false to be certain of having discovered in the language of Beowulf such effects as intentional irony .
A formulaic element need not be held meaningless merely because it was selected with little conscious reflection .
"Time-servers , though the periphrastic expressions are , they may nevertheless be handsome or ironic or humorous ."
Nouns and adjectives in a written tradition are chosen for the nonce ; ;
Reliance is therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological particulars in an oral poem ; ;
no-one today would hope to discover the unmistakable ruins of Heorot or the palace of Priam .
A ship at dry-dock could be called a foamy-necked floater in Anglo-Saxon or a swift ship in Greek .
The epic language was not entirely the servant of the poet ; ;
"The poet's intentions are difficult to discern and , except to biographers , unimportant ; ;"
The closest scrutiny is owed to the Anglo-Saxon kennings and the Homeric epithets ; ;
"The Iliad has two words for the shield , ASPIS and SAKOS ."
Dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers .
"Orlick might almost be Magwitch's bogy man come alive , a figure of nemesis from Pip's phantasy of guilt ."
"But only in one of its aspects is Great Expectations a tale of violence , revenge , and retribution ."
In both cases the finger-post represents Pip's heightened awareness of contrary magnetisms .
A variety of hand movements helps dramatize the moral climate of the fallen world Pip encounters beyond the forge .
Pumblechook's hands throughout the novel serve to travesty greed and hypocritical self-aggrandizement .
"i.e. , it must be left-justified in the operand column of the coding sheet ."
Illustrations of the use of continuation cards are included throughout the examples illustrating the various statements .
any such reference will make the index word or electronic switch unavailable at the end of this pass .
Index words and electronic switches may be reserved in the following ways .
The first two methods apply to both index words and electronic switches ; ;
If a statement has been assigned an address in the index word area
These entries should normally appear at the beginning of the program or immediately following each LITORIGIN statement .
"Otherwise , symbolic names may have previously been assigned to these same index words ."
Autocoder declarative statements provide the processor with the necessary information to complete the imperative operations properly .
"If the compiler does encounter such statements , a warning message will be issued ."
"DA , DC , DTF , and DLINE require more than one entry ."
The DA statement is used to name and define the positions and length of fields within an area .
The DC statement is used to name and enter constants into the object program .
The DRDW statement may also be used to generate an RDW defining any area specified by the programmer .
An individual switch or the entire set of switches in a word may be tested or altered as desired .
"The DIOCS , DTF , and DUF statements are used when required by the Input/Output Control System ."
"Each tape file must be described by Tape File Specifications , produced by Aj ."
The DUF also supplies the locations of subroutines written by the user that are unique to the file .
This statement also allows the naming of the index words used by Aj .
The basic format of the DIOCS statement is as follows : anylabel is any symbolic label ; ;
"If the first item in the operand is omitted , the symbolic name IOCSIXF will be assigned ."
"If the second item in the operand is omitted , the symbolic name IOCSIXG will be assigned ."
"When an actual index word or a symbolic address is specified , Autocoder will equate IOCSIXG to it ."
"In the Midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas ."
O'Connor and Eckenfelder discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes .
The sewage system from Kansas City was not expected to serve the Red Bridge area for several years .
At the same time further expansion in the Red Bridge Subdivision required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities .
The large land areas required for oxidation ponds made this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer .
The side slopes were coated with fiberglas matting coated with asphalt to prevent erosion .
The major contributor was a shopping center with houses being added to the system as the subdivision developed .
The aerator had a variable-speed drive to permit operation through a range of speeds .
The effluent was collected through two pipes and discharged to the Blue River through a surface drainage ditch .
Weekly samples would make any changes more readily discernible than daily samples .
Grab samples were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating conditions .
The BOD of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a subdivision .
The periods of high effluent BOD occurred during cold periods when operational problems with the aerator resulted .
With the spring rains the flow rose rapidly due to infiltration in open sewers .
"As construction progresses , the volume of storm drainage will be sharply reduced ."
The large amount of vegetable grindings from the grocery store in the shopping center created a suspended solids problem .
A skimming device at the effluent weir prevented loss of most of these light solids .
Variations in aerator speeds during the latter two months of this study caused increased mixing and increased oxygen demand .
The suspended solids discharged in the effluent were found to be the major source of the Aj .
It was found that the aerated lagoon was an activated sludge system rather than an oxidation pond .
The floc particles were all small as the heavier floc settled out .
"Initially , the flagellated protozoa predominated , but they soon gave way to the free swimming ciliated protozoa ."
"As the temperature decreased , the number of free swimming ciliated protozoa decreased ."
"but as the temperature rose , the numbers of protozoa increased rapidly ."
The predomination of free swimming ciliated protozoa is indicative of a high bacterial population .
One of the important aspects of this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator .
Routine determinations were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen uptake rates .
The added resistance to the rotor damaged the drive belts and reduced the oxygen transfer capacity .
A series of eight special tests were conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate .
Five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover .
During this study septic conditions developed in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted .
Shortly after this study ended septic conditions resulted which required the addition of sodium nitrate .
Microscopic examination of the effluent showed that minimum BOD occurred when the algae began to decrease with cold weather .
"When the algae began to build up again , the effluent BOD rose ."
The last category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and near terminals and bases .
The submarine now has a definite place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to ocean areas .
It includes operational intelligence of the enemy and knowledge of the environment .
Operational intelligence presumably will be available from our national intelligence agencies ; ;
intelligence on the environment will come from the recently augmented program in oceanography .
"Consequently , air , surface , and submarine elements overshadow the mine , fixed installations , and intelligence ."
Each seems to strive for elimination of the necessity for the others .
"This , despite postwar experience demonstrating that all elements are necessarily mutually supporting ."
"Thus , the most productive areas are not necessarily the most stressed ."
Then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements can be channeled to produce cumulative progress toward a common objective .
"While one element is announcing progress , another is delineating its problems ."
An over-all concept will guide industry where available talents and facilities will yield greatest dividends .
That which follows will be a discussion of principles and possible content for an over-all concept of antisubmarine warfare .
"Russia possesses the preponderance of submarines in the world , divided between her various fleets ."
Some are also in Albania and others are on loan to Egypt .
Other countries which may willingly or unwillingly become Communist can furnish bases .
"Communist target areas can be assumed , but there is no certainty that such assumptions coincide with Soviet intentions ."
"It is a war of attrition , of single actions , of an exchange of losses ."
This exchange must result in our ending up with some effective units .
"As detection ranges increase , weapons will be developed to attack other submarines and surface craft at these ranges ."
Some limitations of one element can be compensated for by a capability of another .
"Therefore , the plan's fifth principle must be that it capitalize on the capabilities of all elements in combination ."
Numbers would be astronomical and current fiscal policies make this an impractical solution .
"Shipbuilding , aircraft procurement , and weapon programs indicate that there will not be enough of anything ."
"it must be flexible enough to allow for technological breakthroughs , scientific progress , and changes in world conditions ."
"Before considering these elements in more detail , an additional requirement should be stated ."
But it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented geographically .
"Good operational intelligence can ensure sound planning , greatly reduce force requirements , and increase tactical effectiveness ."
"Gathering intelligence is important , but of equal importance is its translation into usable form ."
A program is needed to translate the results of oceanographic research into tactical and operating instructions .
"Variations in sound velocity should be measured rather than temperature , because more of the variables would be encompassed ."
A concurrent effort is needed to make oceanographic data useful on the spot .
By its nature it has always been of great psychological advantage and small efforts have required considerably greater counter-efforts .
A most attractive feature is that detection and attack are combined in a single package .
Systems covering the Gulf of St. Lawrence and possibly the entire coasts of the United States are not impossible .
Fixed installations are increasingly advocated as the problem of area defense emerges .
The proponents are scientific and technical men who exercise considerable influence on their military counterparts .
"Systems which detect submarines over wide areas are attractive , although they can be only `` burglar alarms '' ."
No general installation should be made until a model installation has been proved and its maximum capability determined .
"In addition , proposals for fixed installations should be carefully weighed against a counterpart mobile system ."
Fixed installations will always lack the flexibility that should be inherent in naval systems .
But the submarine is a weapon of ambush and therefore always in danger of being ambushed .
Fragment A has been obtained in crystalline form as a dioxalate salt and free base .
One of the most interesting findings was the extreme sensitivity of plasma arylesterases to rare earth ions .
Various metal ions have been found to protect plasma arylesterase against inactivation by urea and guanidine .
The non-identity of serum and red blood cell arylesterase was also established .

A simple process for the preparation of nearly monodisperse polystyrene of predictable molecular weight has been developed .
In this publication measurements of interfacial angles of crystals are used to classify and identify chemical substances .
Great interest and practical help have been given by the Barker Index Committee .
"Financial and material help have come from academic , governmental , and industrial organizations in England and Holland ."
The Barker system is based on the use of the smallest number of interfacial angles necessary for indexing purposes .
"Other morphological , physical , and optical property values are also given ."
The index is essentially a new treatment of previously compiled morphological data .
Every calculation has been made independently by two workers and checked by one of the editors .
An alphabetical list of chemical and mineralogical names with reference numbers enables one to find a particular crystal description .
The Geological Society of America gave a grant-in-aid to complete the work and bore the expenses of publication .
The continuity of the project is suggested by plans for an eventual third edition .
Crystallographic data resulting mainly from X-ray and electron diffraction measurements are presented .

"In earlier years , the preservation of food was essentially related to survival ."
An early hope that irradiation might be the ultimate answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon dispelled .
Of special concern is the growth of bacteria such as Clostridium botulinum which generate poisonous products .
Enzymatic action in stored food produces changes which can adversely affect the appearance of food or its palatability .
The term `` sterilization '' applies to methods involving essentially complete destruction of all microorganisms .
Less severe thermal treatment as by blanching or scalding serves to inactivate enzymes .
"It will , however , inhibit the sprouting of potatoes and other root vegetables ."
"Preserving foods with ionizing radiation leads to some undesirable side effects , particularly at the higher radiation dosages ."
"Aside from availability and economic considerations , each has certain practical advantages ; ;"
Costs of the effective energy produced by these sources is a major obstacle in the development of food-preservation processes .
What are the possibilities of lowered radiation production costs for the future ? ?
"For them , providing appetizing food under battle or emergency conditions is a paramount consideration ."
"High nutritional value , variety , palatability , and appetizing appearance are important for reasons of morale ."
"Foods for rear stations , which require cooking , but no refrigeration , are also of interest ."
"Commercial interest is chiefly in this type of treatment , as is military interest under peacetime conditions ."
The present status of food preservation by ionizing radiation is discussed by food classes in the following paragraphs .
"To date , the one meat showing favorable results at sterilization doses is pork ."
Tests with beef have been largely unsuccessful because of the development of off-flavors .
"Off-flavor is a less severe problem with the radiopasteurization of meats , but problems of commercial acceptability remain ."
The preradiation blanching process discolors the treated beef and liquid accumulates in prepackaged cuts .
Cooked beef irradiated in the absence of oxygen assumes an unnatural pink color .
"However , a major problem here is one of scale of processing ; ;"
Irradiation using the nuclide source is more expensive than use of an electron accelerator .
Acceptable taste and odor are retained by the irradiated and refrigerated chicken .
"Furthermore , it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible ."
"This , too , is recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut ."
The measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily be carried out .
Hesiometer results have been found to compare excellently with manual knife scratching tests .
At low thicknesses a cutting ( or shearing ) phenomenon is often encountered .
"As the coating becomes thicker , the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking type of failure ."
"If the coating becomes still thicker , a peeling type failure finally can occur ."
Presumably the interfacial bond strength and gross cohesive properties are identical in each case .
"What then , are the factors that contribute to these phenomena ? ?"
The cutting ( or shearing ) removal process has been previously described .
It was found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely by cohesive failure .
"The action and reaction forces are R and Af , respectively , and are equal and opposite in direction ."
Af is the force required to cut a coating of thickness T from the substrate .
"Af and Af are the thrust forces acting against coating and knife , respectively ; ;"
Af is the normal compressive force acting on the shear plane ; ;
**yf is the angle the shear plane makes with the substrate ; ;
and **yb is the angle the resultants make with the plane of the substrate .
It is difficult to measure the direction and magnitude of R directly .
These two values and the rake angle **yc are sufficient to determine the other parameters of these relationships .
"This signifies that **yc , the rake angle , is no longer a constant to zero film thickness ."
"The blunter the knife , the higher is the value of Af ."
"The importance of a hard , abrasion-resistant knife material like the Carboloy employed in the Hesiometer immediately becomes apparent ."
"Softer knives would blunt very rapidly , making the value of Af inexact ."
In extreme cases of very soft knives this value may even change during the course of a measurement .
"The resultant friction force , Af is thus directly proportional to Af and consequently also to film thickness ."
"Since the load L , under actual cutting conditions is caused by Af , it can be seen that Af"
"This is a chipping , dynamic type failure encountered with very brittle coatings resins or very highly pigmented films ."
"In the next , the shear plane angle is high , and extends to the inclined work surface ."
"Many of the other foamed plastics , particularly the styrenes , show similar growth potential ."
And there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be evaluated .
"another reports that a cellular polypropylene , primarily for use in wire coating applications , is being investigated ."
Urethane foam as an insulator is also coming in for a good deal of attention .
"Furniture upholstery , as just one example , can easily take millions of pounds ; ;"
foamed refrigerator insulation is under intensive evaluation by every major manufacturer ; ;
"Urethane foams are , basically , reaction products of hydroxyl-rich materials and polyisocyanates ( usually tolylene diisocyanate ) ."
The polyether glycols are claimed to give flexible urethanes a spring-back action which is much desired in cushioning .
The polyester urethane foam is generally produced with adipic acid polyesters ; ;
the polyether group generally consists of foams produced with polypropylene glycol or polypropylene glycol modified with a triol .
"In the prepolymer system , the isocyanate and resin are mixed anhydrously and no foaming occurs ."
The single curve line represents a specific formulation in a test example .
"Where flexural strength is an important factor , be sure that your urethane foam processor is aware of it ."
This property refers to the greatest longitudinal stress or tension a material can endure without tearing apart .
"( like compression strength of urethane foams , it has a direct relationship to formulation ."
Slab stock is still one of the most important forms of urethane end-product in use today .
The ingredients are fed from tanks through a hose and into the mixer at a predetermined rate .
The mixing head moves back and forth slowly across the width of the receptacle .
Much has been done in the way of ingenious slitters to fabricate the slab stock into finished products .
The convoluted sheets can be combined to attain certain cushioning effects mechanically rather than chemically .
Only by resorting to molding techniques can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily in the established cushion market .
Satisfactory methods for polyester foams and even prepolymer polyether foams were never fully achieved .
"While there are still many bugs to be ironed out , the technique is fast developing ."
During the rinsing operation the volume in the tubs gradually increases until overflow from the main drain begins .
The run is complete when all the water has drained off into the waste line .
This method of rinsing appears to produce maximum cleansing with minimum soil redeposition .
Evaluation may be made on either a soil-removal or a grease-removal basis as desired .
"A reflectance-measuring instrument may be desirable to measure cleaning , whereas Soxhlet extraction is necessary to measure grease removal ."
These tests are not accelerated and must be repeated to evaluate dimensional changes after repeated launderings .

"Image intensifier based upon the `` multipactor '' principle , ( D )"
"Transmission secondary electron multiplication image intensifiers ( TSEM tubes ) , ( E )"
Image intensifiers based upon the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable resolution is concerned .
"However , electrostatic focus , important for many applications , has not been realized for these devices ."
Resolution limitations with electrostatic focus might be anticipated due to chromatic aberrations .
Cascaded single stages enclosed by a common envelope have been constructed with high gain and high resolution .
The electron optical system may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one .
"The magnification may be smaller , equal , or larger than unity ."
"As it will be discussed later , peripheral defocusing can be improved on by utilizing curved fiber couplers ."
"It should be noted , however , that the paraxial resolution is quite similar for both electron optical systems ."
"Therefore , we shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capabilities of such tubes ."
"The effect of device and quantum noise , associated with such low input levels , will be described ."
"After these theoretical considerations , constructional details of a fiber-coupled , double-stage X-ray image intensifier will be discussed ."
The tube design which forms the basis of the theoretical discussion shall be described now .
The cylindrical focusing electrode permits adjustment of the positive lens part by varying the focusing potential .
"The anode potential codetermines the gain , G , and magnification , M , of the stage ."
The second photocathode and both phosphor surfaces are deposited on the fiber plate substrates .
The luminous flux gain of a single stage is given by : Af .
"If the input light distribution falls beyond the visible range , Af as expected , since Af ."
The efficiency of fiber optics plates depends on four factors : ( A )
The numerical aperture of the fibers is given by : Af where Af .
"This condition can be satisfied , e.g. , with Af and Af or equivalent glass combinations ."
"For phosphor to fiber and fiber to air surfaces , and assuming Af , we obtain Af percent ."
"Hence , the Af factor for the output fiber coupler is Af ."
It might be anticipated that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further .
This relatively high value is probably due to the small fiber diameters increasing the number of internal reflections .
The efficiency Af of an Af lens at the magnification Af is : Af .
The resolution capabilities of an electrostatic system depend on both the choice of magnification and chromatic aberrations .
"In general , a high anode voltage reduces chromatic aberrations and thus increases the obtainable resolution ."
The following efficiencies obtained from JEDEC and RCA specifications were used : Af
Electrostatic systems of the pseudo-symmetric type have been tested for resolution capabilities by applying electronography .
"The set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy ."
The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ;
The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired .
The objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ;
At each step of the calculation the operating variables of only one stage need be varied .
Thus a number of operations of the order of Af are required .
"Suppose that Af , and that the average operation requires only Af sec. ."
This is the principle which we will invoke in every case to set up a functional equation .
It appears in a form that is admirably suited to the powers of the digital computer .
This transformation is uniquely determined by Af and we therefore speak of the process as deterministic .
An optimal policy is an admissible policy Af which maximizes the objective function P .
"In finding the optimal R-stage policy from that of Af stages , only the function Af is needed ."
A moment's reflection shows that the above algorithm and presentation work equally well in this case .
A form of objective function that we shall often have occasion to consider is Af .
"If Af denotes the net profit from stage R and Af , then the principle of optimality gives Af ."
For a single stage we may define Af where the maximization is by choice of Af .
We thus have an optimal policy which maximizes the expected value of the objective function for a given Af .
"Then Af , the maximization being over all admissible Af and the integration over the whole of stage space ."
The word distance is used here in a rather general sense ; ;
it may in fact be the time that will elapse before the end of the process .
P denotes the state at any point T and Q the vector of operating variables there .
The platform angle **yf is the angle about which the gyro is controlling .
"This torque causes the entire system to rotate about the **yf axis , since the response to Af ."
The angle generated by the platform servo **yf multiplied by G is the effective acceleration acting on the accelerometer .
The voltage Af is amplified by Af and applied to the gyro torquer with scale factor Af .
"With these factors included , an upper limit is placed on the allowable loop gain by stability considerations ."
"In this type of system , a high loop gain is desirable because it provides a fast response time ."
"In addition , the cutoff frequency for input accelerations is approximately proportional to the servo loop gain ; ;"
"i.e. , high loop gain causes the system to respond to horizontal components of accelerations ."
This problem usually determines the lower limit of loop gain rather than response time .
"In practice , the preflight leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the airframe ."
One solution to the problem is to operate with a low loop gain and to include low-pass filters .
This technique causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components such as the platform tilt .
"Since a lower loop gain and low-pass filtering increases the response time , a practical compromise must be reached ."
One of the most desirable solutions is achieved by the use of a non-linear amplifier for Af .
The amplifier is designed so that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold level .
The amount of platform dip required depends upon the scale factors of the system .
"This leveling system will hold the platform on-level , automatically , as long as the system is actuated ."
The process consists in turning the platform manually until the outputs of both accelerometers are zero .
The turning is accomplished by applying voltage to the gyro torquers described above .
"Also , it requires more time as compared to the automatic approach ."
Manual leveling is inconvenient if the platform must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged period of time .
"In simpler terms , it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction ."
Use of the characteristics of the platform components for an indication of true heading .
"With the gyro-stabilized platform leveled , it can be headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques ."
"Before the accelerometers are mounted on the platform , the direction of their sensitive axis must be accurately determined ."
A precision transit is set up so that it is aligned with respect to true north .
This can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques .
The images can easily be aligned with a high degree of accuracy .
The platform is turned as required by supplying currents to the appropriate gyro torquers .
"With this situation , it is difficult to sight in on the platform with surveying equipment ."
The electrical signal from the autocollimator is amplified and supplied to the Z-gyro torquer .
"If the polarity is correct , the platform will turn until the heading error angle is zero ."
Information is also available from this autocollimator system to set the drift bias for the Z-axis gyro .
Gyrocompass alignment is an automatic heading system which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true heading .
"Thus , if one accelerometer is properly aligned , the other is also ."
The input axis of the appropriate gyros are parallel to the sensitive direction of the accelerometers .
The sensing of this rotation by the X gyro can be utilized to direct the platform into proper heading .
"The point is at a latitude **yl , and the platform is at an error in heading east ."
"When the platform is level , **ye is a rotation about the Z axis of the platform Af ."
Scotty accepted the decision with indifference and did not enter the arguments .
Scotty regarded the ear and the grizzled hair around it with a moment of interest .
"He said more loudly , `` I'm full , old Pop '' ."
`` I can fix him something later in the afternoon when we get home '' .
his lips and the usually sharp lines of his jaw had become swollen-looking .
"He breathed now with his mouth open , showing a whitely curving section of lower teeth ; ;"
The doctors had suggested Scotty remain most of every afternoon in bed until he was stronger .
"Since Mr. McKinley had to give a lecture , Rachel and Scotty drove home alone in the Plymouth ."
"Scotty gazed out at ugly gray slums and said softly , `` Look at those stupid kids '' ."
"It was a Negro section of peeling row houses , store-front churches and ragged children ."
And then : `` There are lots of kids around here '' .
"Scotty looked at the children , his mouth slightly opened , his eyes dull ."
"the days seemed short , perhaps because his routine was , each day , almost the same ."
He rose late and went down in his bathrobe and slippers to have breakfast either alone or with Rachel .
"Rachel , observing , would say , `` He has to rediscover his own capacity ."
"Both watched Scotty constantly , Rachel without seeming to , Virginia openly , her eyes filled with concern ."
it was like the bandaged wound on the back of his head which occasionally throbbed ; ;
"She said , `` I notice the girl from across the street hasn't bothered to phone or visit '' ."
"He thought about it briefly , then deliberately turned the talk to something else ."
The heavy branches in his front yard would hide and then reveal them .
They turned at the bottom of Kate's steps and moved off in the direction of the park .
Then they disappeared and Scotty got up and went into his own room and got into bed .
By the time he was under the covers he had forgotten about seeing Kate .
Scotty did not mind the doctor's unsmiling teasing as he used to .
"his delicate hand , as veined as a moth's wing , rested absently on Scotty's chest ."
`` I think by the end of next week he could get out in the air a little .
His stethoscope was on the table by Scotty's bed and he picked it up and wagged it at Scotty .
"He said fussily , `` Just keep the cap on those strong emotions '' ."
She smoothed the covers on Scotty's bed and picked things up from the floor .
"She said , `` Do you think you'll miss school '' ? ?"
You could win a popularity contest at that school without any trouble .
"Rachel came close to the bed , bent as if she would kiss him , then moved away ."
"`` I mean , do you feel like seeing Kate '' ? ?"
"There was the slight pain , but it was no different from the throbbing in his head ."
She put the slipper neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed .
Scotty would hear the front door in the evening and then his father's deep slow voice ; ;
"The exchange was almost invariable , and Scotty , in his bed , could hear every word of it ."
It required an energy he no longer possessed to be satirical about his father .
His father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously at the foot of the bed and look at his son .
"Scotty would reply softly and his father , apologetically , would ask him to repeat ."
"Mr. McKinley examined everything with critical care , seeking something material to blame for his son's illness ."
"And another time , without accusation : `` You never wore that scarf I bought you '' ."
"`` Our objective '' , the colonel had said that day of the briefing , `` is Papa-san '' ."
"Gouge , burn , blast , insult it as they would , could anyone really take Papa-san ? ?"
On the forward slope in front of his own post stretched two rows of barbed wire .
"Closer still , regular barricades of barbed wire hung on timber supports ."
Who would clean up the mess when the war was over ? ?
"Smiling at his quixotic thoughts , Warren turned back from the opening and lit a cigarette before sitting down ."
"Tonight a group of men , tomorrow night he himself , would go out there somewhere and wait ."
"He hadn't realized that there would be so much time to think , so many lulls ."
"Somehow he had forgotten what he must have been told , that combat was an intermittent activity ."
Now he knew that the moment illuminated by the vision on the train would have to be approached .
"It could take place tomorrow night , or it might occur months from now ."
"Pressing his cigarette out in the earth , Warren walked to the slit and scanned the jagged hills ."
"While most of his beliefs were still unsettled , he knew that he did not believe in killing ."
He had come because he could not live out his life feeling that he had been a coward .
There were ten men on the patrol which Sergeant Prevot led out that next night .
"`` We just sit quiet and wait '' , Prevot had said ."
"Then we pull out under our mortar and artillery cover , but nobody pulls out until I say so ."
Remember what I said about going out to get anybody left behind ? ?
"The crude wooden boxes of the enemy , our nicely turned gray metal disks ."
Warren tried to shake off the jumble of his fears by looking at the sky .
"His eyes now fixed on White's solid figure , Warren could hear behind him the tread of another ."
He could also hear the stream which he had seen from his position .
"`` It's safe '' , Prevot had said , `` and it provides cover for our noise '' ."
Soon they were picking their way along the edge of the stream which glowed in the night .
"then they turned to the right , climbed the embankment , and walked into the valley again ."
"The dark forms moved like mourners on some nocturnal pilgrimage , their dirge unsung for want of vocal chords ."
"Looming over all , Papa-san leered down at him , threatening a hundred hidden malevolencies ."
"Off in the distance a searchlight flashed on , its beam slashing the sky ."
"Take that spot over there '' , he whispered , pointing to a small clump of blackness ."
Warren handed him the metal box and Prevot quietly disappeared down the line .
"Lying in the grass behind the brush clump , Warren looked about ."
The others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and the brush .
Over his shoulder he could see Prevot with the machine gun crew .
"Although the armored vest fitted the upper part of his body snugly , he felt no security ."
in the distance he saw a band of men who seemed to advance and retreat even as he watched .
"He was aware of insistent inner beatings , as if prisoners within sought release from his rigid body ."
"Even so , he could not ease the tension of his body ; ;"
the rough surface of the earth itself seemed to resist every attempt on his part to relax .
"With leather cups fitted in his handlebars , he steered his bicycle ."
Cried the guard who ran from the hut to shout to other men standing about outside .
"`` Oh , the French are a very curious people '' , Pierre had laughed ."
They refuse to mention or to notice that they are not there .
"I'm used to all three , but I think the French have the healthiest attitude '' ."
That was the day that Pierre had told Warren about the Abbey of Solesmes .
Within two weeks Warren was ringing the bell at the abbey gate .
Mickie sat over his second whisky-on-the-rocks in a little bar next to the funeral parlor on Pennsylvania Avenue .
"The nude was small and black-haired and elfin , and was called `` Eloise '' ."
The other patrons were taxi drivers and art students and small shopkeepers .
I'm sure all girls feel this way about men until they live with them .
"`` But when it comes to war , the Colonel knows what it is and Jeff doesn't ."
He'd shoot at anything if it was the rear end of a horse or his own sentry .
"Before the fight was over , the Harlem boy had a concussion and Trig was cut up badly ."
"They caught Trig stealing liquor from the officers' mess , and he got a couple of girls in trouble ."
It just didn't occur to Trig that anything serious would happen to him .
Do you get the picture of the kind of fellow he was '' ? ?
"We knew the enemy was subdued , because a flare was fired as the signal ."
We don't 'low nigras to walk on the same sidewalk with white men where I come from .
`` The Negro got a bad slice on his chest from the knife wound '' .
"Jefferson Lawrence was alone at the small , perfectly appointed table by the window looking out over the river ."
"No , they must look the other way and climb one more painful step up the ladder ."
"He made the decision with his eyes open , or so he thought ."
"At any cost , he must leave the dreary Pennsylvania mining town where his father was a pharmacist ."
"At State College , he had no time to walk among the violets on the water's edge ."
He had to teach himself patiently that these traps were not for him .
More of this stamping down of human emotion as a young lawyer in New York .
"The only one who would have him was his cripple , the strange unhappy woman who became his wife ."
"He had dared to defy nature , to turn his back to the Lorelei , and he was punished ."
"Lawrence could not put his finger on it precisely , and this worried him ."
"When you disliked or distrusted a man , you should have a reason ."
Human nature was not a piece of meat you could tell was bad by its smell .
"He said to the Secretary , `` I understand you came from a little Pennsylvania town near Wilkes-Barre ."
This young man had so little time to learn he had to be curious ; ;
"The Secretary did not tell him at what cost , at what loneliness , he learned these things ."
"He merely said , `` Any good decorator these days can make you a tasteful home '' ."
"Again , Lawrence thought a little sadly , these were the fees of poverty and ambition ."
He had to acquire everything he was going to get in four years .
"Lawrence listened with the practiced , deceptive calm of the lawyer , but his face was in the shadow ."
"`` So , we have to protect the old man for his own good ."
He's telling them now to write letters to their Congressmen opposing the disarmament of Germany .
"The Bishop looked at him coldly and said , `` Take it or leave it '' ! !"
Wilson came by train from Birmingham and looked the city over ; ;
the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were .
"It was an old and dirty wooden structure , sadly in need of repair ."
"It had just suffered a calamity , the final crisis in a long series of calamities ."
"For the old preacher who had been there twenty-five years was dead , and the city mourned him ."
"He was a loud-voiced man , once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength and ability ."
"A knot of old worshippers , chiefly women , listened weekly to a sermon ."
It sometimes ended in death-like trances with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and floor .
It was often re-enacted in less wild form at the Wednesday night prayer meeting .
"Wilson , on his first Sunday , witnessed this with something like disgust ."
"But then , at mention of that name , the Amen corner broke loose ."
"The children had nowhere to go and no place to play , not even sidewalks ."
One of the leading members of the Amen corner was cook ; ;
Why should a white hotel be set down in the center of Black Bottom ? ?
The best could not escape from the worst and the worst nestled cosily beside the better .
He was not sure what kind of a man he had in hand .
He was sure that he could do better if he went to Atlanta to get the deal financed .
"But when this proposal was made to his Deacon Board , he met unanimous opposition ."
"`` Reverend '' , he said , `` I think you don't quite understand the situation here ."
"Tenements , stores , saloons , some gambling , I hope not too much ."
When a city has arranged things like this you cannot easily change them .
"Then Wilson asked , `` What about this Kent House which you mention ? ?"
I don't understand why a white hotel should be down here '' .
It was next day that Sojourner came and sat beside him and took his hand .
"She said , `` My dear , do you know what Kent House is '' ? ?"
`` It's a house of prostitution for white men with white girls as inmates .
"They hire a good deal of local labor , including two members of our Trustee Board ."
"And after Wilson had talked to Mrs. Catt and to others , he was absolutely amazed ."
"The inmates were white and from out of town , avoiding local friction ."
The backing from the white town was greater and there was little publicity .
"Good wages , patronage and subscription of various kinds stopped open protest from Negroes ."
And yet Wilson knew that this place must go or he must go .
"There was a fog , which increased the darkness of the night ."
The pretence was that he was delivering a prescription from Dr. Verdi .
"The idea had come from Herold , who had once been a chemist's clerk ."
"Before Payne loomed the Old Clubhouse , Seward's home , where Key had once been killed ."
From the outside it was an ordinary enough house of the gentry .
"Like the bell at Mass , the doorbell was pitched too high ."
"If their schedules were to synchronize , there was no point in wasting time ."
"In the half darkness the banisters gleamed , and the hall seemed enormous ."
He brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs .
"They were carpeted , but made for pumps and congress gaiters , not the great clodhoppers he wore ."
At the top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there angrily in a dressing gown .
"Reversing it , he smashed the butt down on Frederick Seward's head , over and over again ."
"The nigger boy fled down the stairs , screaming , `` Murder '' ."
He was merely clearing a way to what he had to do .
"He ran for the sick room , found his pistol was broken , and threw it away ."
"He saw only dimly moving figures , but when he slashed them they yelled and fled ."
"He went for the bed , jumped on it , and struck where he could , repeatedly ."
It was like finally getting into one's own nightmares to punish one's dreams .
"When the knife went into his chest , he went down at once ."
"`` I'm mad '' , shouted Payne , as he ran out into the hall ."
"Somewhere in the fog , the nigger boy was still yelling murder ."
"He unhitched his horse , walked it away , mounted , and spurred it on ."
"he knew he should get to Cap , but he didn't know how ."
"He was sure , for he had done as he was told , hadn't he ? ?"
"In Boston , Edwin Booth was winding up a performance of A New Way To Pay Old Debts ."
It was a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think about it any more .
"They made the world seem friendly somehow , though he knew it was not ."
"The stage had been empty , except for Harry Hawk , doing his star monologue ."
"Then the audience saw a small , dim figure appear at the edge of the Presidential box ."
They had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily .
The play for Saturday night was to be a benefit performance of The Octoroon .
"But it also looked like a toad , hopping away from the light ."
There was something maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them .
"Harry Hawk had not shifted position , but he at last lowered his arm ."
It was what anyone who had ever seen her had always expected her to do .
That absence of an urgent self-indulgence dashed them awake like a pail of water .
"Clara Harris , one of the guests in the box , stood up and demanded water ."
"In Washington City everyone lived in a bubble of plots , and one death might attract another ."
"It was not exactly panic they gave way to , but they could not just sit there ."
"The beehive voices , for no one could bear silence , drowned out the sound of Mrs. Lincoln's weeping ."
"Someone opened the corridor door from the inside , and called for a doctor ."
Somehow Dr. Charles Leale was forced through the mob and squeezed out into the dingy corridor .
"As usual , Mrs. Lincoln had lost her head , but nobody blamed her for doing so now ."
"With a sneer , the man spread his legs and , a third time , confronted them ."
"Stevie twisted and , frantically , commanded the mare to leap straight ahead ."
"With a bold arm , he dared once more to obstruct them ."
"Seizing the bridle , he tugged with all his might and forced Katie to her knees ."
"The man uttered a weird cry , spun about , and collapsed in the sand ."
"He could feel his own feet , iron-shod , striking repeatedly until the body was limp ."
They rode around and around to trample the figure into the sand .
"Only the top of the head , with a spot bare and white as a clamshell , remained visible ."
"Then Katie stumbled , and again he was falling , falling ! !"
"He stared at the far morning , expecting a pendulum to swing across the horizon ."
`` They say that our steeple is one hundred and sixty-two feet high .
"The Catholics had the largest cemetery , near the Neversink River where Main Street ran south ; ;"
"Sometimes they went south and rolled past the tollhouse -- `` Afternoon , Reverend '' ! !"
"In the Delaware River , three long islands were overgrown with greening trees and underbrush ."
Where Cuddleback Brook purled into the Neversink was a magnificent swimming hole .
Papa pointed a scornful finger at the splashing youth : `` Idle recreation '' ! !
"He pulled with all his strength at the heavy , brass-bound door , and shuffled along the wainscoted wall ."
The boy shuddered at the deathly pale countenance with its wrinkles and gray hair .
"The mouth was thin-lipped and wide , the long cleft in the upper lip like a slide ."
"When Papa's slender fingers removed the spectacles , there were red indentations on the bridge of the strong nose ."
"Perhaps one day He will choose you as He chose me , long ago ."
"Therefore , give Him your affection and store up His love for you ."
"Open your heart to Him and pray , Stephen , pray ! !"
"Stevie had heard these words many times , yet on each occasion they caused him to tremble ."
Papa was disappointed that none of the brothers had heard the Call .
"Burt was at Hackettstown and Will at Albany Law School , where they surely could not hear it ."
"The stern face would relax , the black-clad arms would embrace him , `` My son '' ! !"
"Probably , as in Scriptures , a still , small voice would whisper ."
"What if it came when he was playing , or was asleep and dreaming ? ?"
"When the skies grew dark and thunder rolled across the valley , he was unafraid ."
"Aggie might fly into a closet , shut the door and bury her head in the clothes ; ;"
"barrels tumbled down the mountainsides , and bounced and bounced till their own fury split them open ."
A flash illumined the trees as a crooked bolt twigged in several directions .
"He ran out into the downpour , sped across the yard and into the buggy room ."
If there was a fire or a flood he would save Mama first and Violet next .
"Drenched and shaking , he stood near the sweet-smelling stall and dared to pat her muzzle ."
"After the storm , the sky cleared blue and cool , and fragrant air swept the hills ."
"The fountain had brimmed over , the cannon were wet , the soldiers' monument glistened ."
"Even before the benches had dried , the Civil War veterans were straggling back to their places ."
He trailed Ludie to the baseball game in the lot on Kingston Street near the Dutch Reformed .
"No one told on Ludie , not even when he slipped live grasshoppers into the mite-box ."
Ludie took his slingshot and climbed to the rooftop to shoot at crows .
"Ludie hopped rides on freight cars , and was chased by Mr. Yankton , the railroad guard ."
"He came home overheated , ran straight to the ice-chest , and gulped shivery cold water ."
"On the Christophers' lawn , little girls in white pinafores were playing grownups at a tea party ."
"He meandered down Pike Street , past the First National Bank with its green window shades ."
She was so beautiful with her rosy mouth and haughty air that she had to be wicked .
"Rich people went to Delaware House , Opera House , American House or Fowler House ."
"Fresh , warm , sweet and juicy , sweet lovin sixteen , she was ."
"He thought of Joe Harris , the nigger who had gone after his sister ."
The big shock everybody had when they found ol Slater and those others done for .
"He kept sayin , not me , not me , I don't wanta wind up like em ."
"`` I told him '' , he said aloud They'll get the guys that done it ."
There was something troubling him though : as yet they hadn't Five days .
He glowed with anticipation about what would happen to the culprits when they caught them .
He had never heard the word reactionary before his life as a POW began .
"The word also made him feel hate , sincere hate , for those so labeled ."
He used it very effectively when he wanted to get his squad on the ball .
Dirty Reactionary bastards comin down here in the night and bumpin off ol Slater and those other poor bastards .
"The thought came back , the one nagging at him these past four days ."
"He fought it , seeking to kill the last few words , but on they came out ."
"`` bout takin his place '' He listened , waited , nothing happened ."
"He looked over at him , lying there , asleep , and he felt a wave of revulsion ."
"Sleepy-eyed , soft-spoken Johnson , Biggest thorn in my side of the whole fucken squad ."
Like a particle drawn to a magnet he returned to that which was pressing so hard in his mind .
"Knows the score With a supreme effort , he broke it off ."
"He was again tingling with pleasure , seeing himself clearly in Slater's shoes ."
"`` Boy , you're stirrin early '' , a sleepy voice said ."
"`` Yehhh '' , said Coughlin , testily , eyeing him up and down ."
"`` Lookit that come down , willya '' , said the man , scratching himself , yawning ."
"Keep the chatter to a minimum , short answers , one word , if possible ."
"All he does is to bullshit with his squad , and they are the stupidest bastards around ."
You can do anything with these dumb fucks if you know how .
"The man shrank before the hot fury , searching frantically for the answer ."
He looked for the source of the noise that had awakened him .
The waves breakin in on you and your girl at night there on the warm beach in the moonlight .
I hated the goddamn army from the first day I got in anyhow .
"All pricks like Coughlin run it anyway , one way or another ."
"He rolled over and tried to shut out the noise , now much louder ."
He was sitting on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water .
"A river , wide as the Missouri , where it ran by his place ."
Why should I be spinning just because the goddamn log is spinning ? ?
"Over on the bank , the west bank , a man stood , calling to him ."
"Rousseau is so persuasive that Voltaire is almost convinced that he should burn his books , too ."
"`` You must be a very learned man '' , says Voltaire to one of the bandits ."
He refuses to believe that the bandit chief never attended a higher institution .
"When finally the two bedraggled men reach their friend's home , Voltaire's fears are once again aroused ."
"Immediately after dinner , however , Rousseau asks for still another favor ."
And his efforts to get a performance for his Gallant Muses invariably failed .
He was really amazed to discover the other guests so excited about these delicate little songs .
"`` Put a few such songs together '' , they urged him ."
"`` String them onto some sort of little plot , and you'll have a delightful operetta '' ."
`` This is the sort of stuff I write and then throw away '' ! !
And they wouldn't leave off arguing and pleading until he had promised .
The fault was Rameau's and that of the whole culture of this Parisian age .
"That glory , craved for so long , was now forbidden to him ."
And everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote .
"Duclos , the historian , pointed out to Jean Jacques that this was impossible ."
The musicians of the Royal Opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound .
"`` Let me do the submitting to the Royal Academy '' , he suggested ."
But I said I would first have to get the author's permission .
"On the contrary , he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of several days ."
"`` If they are here , then surely I have the right to be here '' , Rousseau said ."
`` Is it because of my slovenliness that hair grows on my face ? ?
A hundred years ago I would have worn a beard with pride .
And those without beards would have stood out as not dressed for the occasion .
"Now times have changed , and I must pretend that hair doesn't grow on my face ."
"Now , if you don't mind , I should like to hear my own piece performed '' ."
But of course behind his boldness he didn't feel bold at all .
It was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began .
"He came spurring and whooping down the road , his horse kicking up clouds of dust , shouting :"
"We heard him before he ever showed , and we heard him yelling after he was out of sight ."
"Solomon Chandler hadn't misjudged the strength of his lungs , not at all ."
but I do know that he gave the day tone and distinction .
"He was a fine and showy rider , but his skill was wasted on us ."
It was my initiation to war and the insane symphony war plays ; ;
for what had happened on the common was only terror and flight ; ;
"I must state that the faster things happened , the slower they happened ; ;"
"It was only hours since I had last seen them , but they had changed and I had changed ."
"In the very front rank , two men were wounded and staggered along , trailing blood behind them ."
"No drummers here , no pipers , and the red coats were covered with a fine film of dust ."
"They marched with bayonets fixed , and as fixed on their faces was anger , fear , and torment ."
"In the course of this , they had fired on us ; ;"
Later we realized that the redcoats had stopped their charge at the wall .
Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching .
"Isaac Pitt , one of the men from Lincoln , had taken a musket ball in his belly ; ;"
"Meanwhile , I reloaded my gun , as the other men were doing ."
"Someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it , the British would be gone ; ;"
"That settled it , and we broke into parties of two and three ."
Cousin Simmons grabbed one of them by the shoulder and flung him away .
"That summer the gambling houses were closed , despite the threats of Pierre Ameaux , a gaming-card manufacturer ."
"Plunking themselves down on the front bench , they turned to smirk at those around them ."
"`` I have told you before , and I tell you again '' , Monsieur Favre said rudely ."
"Monsieur Favre sat down in his high-backed stall , lips compressed , eyes glinting ."
"Ablard Corne , a short man with a rotunda of stomach , rose ."
How can we have a good city unless we respect morality '' ? ?
"Abel Poupin , a tall man with sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes , got to his feet ."
`` We all know that Jake Camaret and the woman are brazenly living together .
It would be well to show the populace how we deal with adulterers '' .
He is throttling the liberty my father gave his life to win '' ! !
`` There can be no compromise when souls are in jeopardy '' .
"Let evildoers contemplate their ways , and let every man beware '' ! !"
"The blue-draped Virgin was still there , but no one knelt before her now ."
"Snow buried the streets and covered the slanting rooftops , as John trudged toward St. Peter's ."
"A carriage crunched by , its dim lights filtering through the gloom ."
"The city had recently given him a small salary , but it was not enough to supply even necessities ."
"As he neared the square , a round figure muffled in a long , black cape whisked by ."
There were several on the Council who tried to live like Christians .
"Despite their efforts , the problems seemed to grow graver all the time ."
"I have never asked for an easy task , but I am weary of the strife '' ."
And Anthony was busy most of the time courting this girl and that .
"Refugees poured in , signing the Confession and rules in order to remain , and then disregarding them ."
"Dice rolled , prostitutes plied their trade , thieves stole , murderers stabbed , and the ungodly blasphemed ."
Catholics who were truly Christians longed for the simple penance of days gone by .
"Unless the confusion cleared , he would not be coming here much longer ."
The slow tapping of a cane on the stone steps coming up to the tower interrupted his reverie .
"Faint at first , the tapping grew until it sounded loud against the wind ."
"I went to your rooms , and Anthony told me you were here ."
"Two Anabaptists , Caroli and Benoit , are to challenge you and William to a debate before the Council ."
`` You are to be accused of Arianism to confuse the religious who remain loyal '' .
Ever since the fourth century a controversy had raged over the person of Christ .
"So John had refused to agree to his appointment as a preacher , and now Caroli sought revenge ."
"`` If William agrees , we should insist on a public debate '' , he said at length ."
"Bern demands that the Lord's Supper be administered here as it used to be , with unleavened bread ."
`` That I would rather be banished with two such Christians than be made the Chief Syndic '' ! !
"He wanted to run , but he knew that if he did , he would be lost ."
On the outskirts of the rabble the Camaret brothers and Gaspard Favre shook their fists .
`` Are you going to comply with the demands of Bern '' ? ?
`` Know this : the ministers will not yield to the demands of Bern '' .
"When he felt the side of his head , his fingers came away covered with blood ."
"Pierre Ameaux , the gaming-card manufacturer said , his little pig eyes glaring ."
Then he slipped and went down on his hands and knees in the melting snow .
At once a bevy of dogs was snapping and snarling around him .
"One , more horrible than the rest , lunged , growling deep in his throat , his hair bristling ."
"With great difficulty John clambered to his feet and started to run , sweat pouring down his face ."
"There was , of course , no real need to rearrange everything ."
"He wondered what expression , as he made that gesture , was on his face ."
"He wondered if it wore the old anxiety , or the old , taut stoicism ."
Then why was he assuming the role -- the gesture and the suffering ? ?
The chimney of the hut across from him was surmounted by a beef barrel with ends knocked out .
"In this heavy air , however , that device did not seem to help ."
"Over the door was a board with large , inept lettering : home sweet home ."
"If only Simms Purdew could do that , whatever the thing he remembered and told ."
"It would be a sign for the untellable , and he , Adam , would understand ."
He saw the sign above the door of the hut : home sweet home .
"The drizzle was slacking off now , but the light was grayer ."
"Into the emptiness of the street , and his spirit , moved a form ."
"The form was swathed in an army blanket , much patched , fastened at the neck with a cord ."
From under the shapeless huddle of blanket the feet moved in the mud .
"Moisture ran down the cheeks , gathered at the tip of the nose , and at the chin ."
The figure was close enough now for him to see the nose twitching to dislodge the drop clinging there .
The figure stopped and one hand was perilously freed from the hamper to scratch the nose .
This was one of the Irish women who had built their own huts down near the river .
"He could not make out , but he knew that again she was scratching her nose ."
The words ran crazily in his head : Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose in the rain .
"He looked wildly around , at the now empty street , at the mud , at the rain ."
"His mind closed on that prospect , as though fog had descended to blot out a valley ."
"Far off , in the dusk , he heard voices singing , muffled but strong ."
"In one of the huts a group of men were huddled together , singing ."
Let the water and the blood From Thy riven side flow ! !
"He had crossed the river which now , beyond the woods yonder , was sliding darkly under the mist ."
"He thought of the men , the nameless thousands , huddling in them ."
"He felt the sweetness of pity flood through him , veining his very flesh ."
"Those men , lying in the huts , they did not know ."
They did not know who they were or know their own worth .
He is going to let History take the blame for a while '' .
He thought of the old man laughing under the glitter of the great chandelier .
He thought : Only in my heart can I make the world hang together .
"He saw Mose squatting by the hearth , breaking up hardtack into a pan ."
"`` Chicken '' , Mose said , and theatrically licked his lips ."
He dumped the pan of crumbled hardtack into the boiling pot of lobscouse .
"`` Good ole lob-scuse '' , he mumbled , and stirred the pot ."
`` Know what I had to fix fer Ole Him '' ? ?
"She lost not a second , picking herself up and continuing her pilgrimage to Laura ."
In a few minutes she was making the ten-foot hike unaided ; ;
"soon she was parading around the house , flaunting her new skill ."
"`` Y'all should have let me take that money out '' , Andrus said ."
"With a hard eye , she informed Moll : `` Don't sure 'nuff me , officer ."
"The maid was very black and very energetic , trim in a yellow pique uniform ."
"she was one of Eliot Sparling's neutralized minorities , adopting the rolling R's and constricted vowels of Los Angeles ."
"She answered him precisely , missing not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial reports ."
"When the parents emerged from the bedroom a few minutes later , the maid greeted them quietly ."
"During the night , a phone company technician had deadened the bells and installed red blinkers on the phones ."
He wanted to take the mother to headquarters at once and start her on the mug file .
"The woman had the glassy look of an invalid , as if she had not slept at all ."
"`` Didn't occur to me my child would be kidnaped when I had it listed '' , Andrus muttered ."
McFeeley told the parents he would escort them to police headquarters in a half hour .
"In contrast to the caravan of the previous night , there were only four cars parked across the street ."
Two men he did not recognize were sipping coffee and munching sweet rolls .
"However , the litter remained , augmented by several dozen lunchroom suppers ."
"One of the reporters called to him : `` Anything new , Lieutenant '' ? ?"
"And he ignored him , skirting the parked cars and walking up the path to the Skopas house ."
"Flanked by marble urns and alabaster lamps , they seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait ."
"a gross boy in his teens , shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands ; ;"
"a girl in her twenties , fat and sullen , descending the marble staircase ; ;"
"yes , they had let some reporters use their phone , but they would no longer ."
"Studying them , McFeeley could not help make comparison with the Andrus couple ."
The Skopas people seemed to him of that breed of human beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy .
"They possessed no outer fortifications , no hard shells of confidence ; ;"
"they had enough difficulty getting from day to day , let alone having an awful crime thrust upon them ."
"McFeeley noted the immaculate lawn and gardens : each blade of grass cropped , bright and firm ; ;"
"When Joe identified himself , he nodded , unsmiling , and ushered him into a sedate living room ."
"She had a dried-out quality -- a gray , lean woman , not unattractive ."
Mr. Kahler went on to explain how Hausman's fox terrier had been `` making '' in his flower beds .
"The dog refused to be scared off , so Kahler had purchased some small firecrackers ."
He found the pilot light and turned on one of the burners for her .
And put water on to boil and then searched through the icebox .
Eugene put a spoonful of powdered coffee into his cup and then filled it with hot water .
They assured him that they did not expect or need to be entertained .
"Every time he moved or said something , the chair creaked again ."
"They passed the marmalade , the bread , the black-market butter , back and forth ."
The first shrill ring of the telephone brought Harold out into the hall .
The telephone was in the study but the ringing came from the hall .
`` She wants you and Barbara to have dinner with her tomorrow night '' .
"A young woman who looked like Alix , with her two children ."
Matching photographs in oval frames of Mme Bonenfant and an elderly man who must be Alix's grandfather .
It was the kind of frame that is only put around the photograph of a dead person .
"With the metal shutters closed , the dining room was so dark that it seemed still night in there ."
"The apex , the study where Eugene slept , was light and bright and airy and cheerful ."
The window looked out on the Place Redoute -- it was the only window of the apartment that did .
"The daybed Eugene had slept in , made up now with its dark-brown velours cover and pillows ."
The portable record player with a pile of classical records beside it .
He moved over to the desk and stood looking at the papers on it but not touching anything .
The concierge called out to them as they were passing through the foyer .
"Rather than sit around waiting for the suitcases to be delivered , they had gone sight-seeing ."
"Cheap clothing and junk of every sort , as far as the eye could see ."
"When he opened the door , there stood Eugene , on his way out of the apartment ."
"He did not explain where he was going , and they did not ask ."
`` Do you think he could be having an affair '' ? ?
He reached out and felt the bath towel hanging on the towel rack over the tub .
"He looked around the room and then called out : `` Come here , quick '' ? ?"
"But if he has time to go swimming , he had time to be with us '' ."
`` I don't know what I'm going to do with you '' .
"`` It's because we are in France '' , he said , `` and know so few people ."
"And in any case , answers may clarify but they do not change anything ."
"He brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes , of about a hundred pounds' weight ."
His first desire was to create a mother and son alone in the universe .
When might Mary have had that moment to hold her child on her lap ? ?
Those who saw his finished Pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses .
"He felt close to Mary , having spent so long concentrating on the beginning of her journey ."
It was a relief to shift in his mind to technical problems .
He started by making free sketches to loosen up his thinking so that images would appear on paper .
"When the cloth dried and stiffened , he saw what adjustments had to be made ."
They can have as much tactile appeal as flesh and bone '' .
"many of their gifted members were prominent in the Vatican as physicians , musicians , bankers ."
He was told to ask for Rabbi Melzi at the synagogue on Saturday afternoon .
He was reading from the Talmud with a group of men from his congregation .
"When Michelangelo explained why he had come , Rabbi Melzi replied gravely :"
"That is why our creative people give their time to literature , not to painting or sculpture '' ."
"`` But , Rabbi Melzi , you don't object to others creating works of art '' ? ?"
I will send you the best the quarter has to offer '' .
"Together he and Argiento built the stand , covering it with blankets ."
He worked for two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi .
but he had sketched the women of Tuscany in their fields and homes .
He was able to discern the body lines of the Roman women under their robes .
"He drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory , without need to consult his sketches ."
Soon he was ready to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay .
Here he would have free expression because the material could be moved to distort forms .
"When he wanted to emphasize , or get greater intensity , he added or subtracted clay ."
Next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence .
the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an elastic pull .
Yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind ; ;
"yet he knew that he had nothing to grumble about , for Argiento made few demands on him ."
The boy was becoming acquainted with the contadini families that brought produce into Rome .
The one thing he missed from his farm in the Po Valley was the animals ; ;
It took a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him .
"Argiento never left his side , keeping the water boiled , applying hot compresses throughout the night ."
Beth was very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps .
"Few of the neighbors came , but Mrs. Tussle came , called by tragedy ."
Kate moved through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment .
She had nothing left but her duty to his land and his son .
Juanita and Mrs. Tussle kept Kate in bed a week until her milk dried .
When she returned to life in the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion save dedication to duty .
"Seeing the slanting hand , Kate knew uneasily that it was from the Yankee colonel ."
The Federal forces had taken Parkersburg and Grafton from the Rebels and were moving to take all the mountains .
He had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from Harpers Ferry .
Uncle Randolph had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own .
"`` You're gonna get caught '' , she heard Joel say to Uncle Randolph by the pump one morning ."
"`` Everybody knows I'm just a harmless , deaf old man who takes to drink ."
I aim to keep a little whisky still back in the ridge for my pleasure '' .
"`` You're back there riding with the guerrillas , the Moccasin Rangers '' ."
"`` Hush '' , said Uncle Randolph , smiling , `` or I'll give you another black eye '' ."
Kate drew more and more on her affection for Joel through the hot days of summer work .
"He had the hardest pains of growing before him now , as he approached twelve ."
"These would be his hardest years , she knew , and he missed his father desperately ."
"She tried to find some way to draw him out , to help him ."
Jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction of Harpers Ferry before they abandoned it ; ;
"The men were restive , he wrote , ready to take the battle to the enemy as Jackson wished ."
"`` Cleaned all them Rebs out'n the hills , they did ! !"
"They won't never git over inter loyal western Virginia , them traitors ! !"
"The Federals is making everybody take the oath of loyalty around these parts too '' , he crowed ."
"After he had gone , Kate asked Uncle Randolph proudly , `` Would you take their oath '' ? ?"
Maj. Anderson of Fort Sumter is home and recruiting volunteers for the U.S. Army .
Rumor of a big battle spread like a grassfire up the valley .
Accounts were garbled at the telegraph office when they sent old George down to Parkersburg for the news .
"It had been a big battle , and the Confederate forces had won ."
Jonathan and Ben were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing .
Joel went to the crest of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate .
Were they to be insulted again because of the South's great victory ? ?
She remembered McClellan's last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the stairs .
"Juanita stopped just inside the open door , her hand to her mouth ."
"She asked , taking him and Juanita into the parlor where the shutters were closed against the afternoon sun ."
`` Where will you go now that you're leaving Parkersburg '' ? ?
"Their eyes betrayed too much of their emotions , she thought sadly ."
"`` Stay here in the parlor where it's cool '' , she said , trying to be calm ."
It would be better for Joel and Uncle Randolph and Mrs. Tussle not to see them .
Kate went back and reminded the kitchen women of the supper preparations .
"`` He wants me to go with him tomorrow '' , she told Kate ."
"He knows me as your niece , which , of course , I am ."
I have held your papers of manumission since I married Mr. Lattimer '' .
The red glow from the cove had died out of the sky .
"`` Well , I'm here at last '' , she said , addressing the old portraits on the walls ."
She came to the ballroom and stood on the two carpeted steps that led down to it .
"Peter , you lummox , you've forgot to order the musicians '' ."
"And this handsome booby , staring and sweating , was he her bridegroom ? ?"
"He had ridden hard from Boston , and he was not used to horseback ."
"He would cross to Manhattan , to Harlem Heights , before morning ."
There a certain farmhouse was a station for the Sons of Liberty .
He would send on by trusted messenger the dispatches with their electrifying news .
"Strange how everything here fitted back into his life , even if he had been away so long ."
"A mist was walking on the water , white as cotton , but with a blending and merging grace ."
David reached for the pair of pistols in the saddlebags at his feet .
A strange wood creature came floating up from a patch of berry bushes .
It had the features of a man bewhiskered by clumps of loose feathers .
"The creature in feathers looked around and David saw the mad eyes , glazed with an insane fear ."
"Husbandry was bounded by snake-rail fences , and there were grazing cattle ."
"The larger ships were near Paulus Hook , already being called , by a few , Jersey City ."
"The fish hawk , his wings not moving , circled and glided lower ."
The captain's gig of H.M.S. Mercury was being rowed to H.M.S. Neptune .
On shore `` the freed slaves to despotism '' -- the town dwellers -- watched the ships and waited .
"The British ships rolled at anchor , sent out picket boats and waited for orders from London ."
The road seemed animated with a few more wagons than usual ; ;
He had sent the dispatches downtown to the proper people and had slept .
Orders not written down had to be transmitted to the local provincial government .
David Cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface .
what mattered was that a new concept of Americans was being born .
The moral aridity of merchants made them loyal usually to their ledgers .
"Yet some , like Morris Manderscheid , would bankrupt themselves for the new ideas ."
One had to believe in final events or one was stranded in the abyss of nothing .
He saw with John Hunter now that the perfectability of man was a dream .
"He drove sensual patterns off , carefully shaving his long upper lip ."
"David finished shaving , washed his face clean of lather , and combed and retied his hair ."
More and more of the colonials were wearing their own hair and not using powder .
"In the meadow below , militia officers shouted at their men and on King's Bridge two boys sat fishing ."
A man could be tossed outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these days .
"The land of the Lublin Uplands was rich , but no one seemed to care ."
In the unfertile land in Palestine humans broke their backs pushing will power to the brink .
He had sat beside Alexander Brandel at the rostrum of a congress of Zionists .
"We are here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest , seeking human dignity ."
"It had sounded good to Andrei , but he did not believe it ."
He loathed the idea of drying up swamps or the chills of malaria or of leaving his natural birthright .
"Before he went into battle Andrei had told Alex , `` I only want to be a Pole ."
They had let this black hole of death in Warsaw's heart exist without a cry of protest .
"Day by day , week by week , month by month , the betrayal gnawed at Andrei's heart ."
"Only Palestine , and I will never live to see Palestine because I did not believe ."
"At a siding , another train which was a familiar sight these days ."
He walked toward the center of the city to keep his rendezvous with Styka .
"Of all the places in Poland , Andrei hated Lublin the most ."
Few of the native Jews who had lived in Lublin were still in the ghetto .
Lublin was the seed of action for the `` final solution '' of the Jewish problem .
"As the messages from Himmler , Heydrich , and Eichmann came in through Alfred Funk , Lublin's fountainhead spouted ."
"A bevy of interlacing lagers , work camps , concentration camps erupted in the area ."
"Ice baths , electric shocks , lashings , wild dogs , testicle crushers ."
"The ghetto , a miniature of Warsaw's , was emptied into the camp in the Majdan-Tartarski suburb called Majdanek ."
Was Operation Reinhard the same pattern for the daily trains now leaving the Umschlagplatz in Warsaw ? ?
"Was there another Majdanek in the Warsaw area , as they suspected ? ?"
Andrei stopped at Litowski Place and looked around quickly at the boundary of civil buildings .
Down the boulevard he could see a portion of the ghetto wall .
"He found an empty bench , opened a newspaper , and stretched his legs before him ."
Krakow Boulevard was filled with black Nazi uniforms and the dirty brownish ones of their Auxiliaries .
`` I have been waiting across the street at the post office since dawn .
"To him , Andrei Androfski had always been the living symbol of a Polish officer ."
His captain was thin and haggard and his beautiful boots were worn and shabby .
I got a girl in trouble and we had to get married .
"Nothing like the old days in the army , but I get by ."
"Many times I tried to reach you , but I never knew how ."
"I came to Warsaw twice , but there was that damned ghetto wall ''"
`` There is a man named Grabski who is the foreman in charge of the bricklayers at Majdanek .
`` He is aware he will not live for twenty-four hours if he betrays you '' .
Perhaps perhaps there is a shred of conscience left in the human race .
Perhaps if they know the story there will be a massive cry of indignation '' .
Until I was transferred into the Seventh Ulanys I was like every other Pole in my feeling about Jews .
"But my captain might have been a Jew , but he wasn't a Jew ."
"What I mean is , he was a Pole and the greatest soldier in the Ulanys ."
The men of our company had a dozen fights defending your name .
`` How can you tell an insane man to reason or a blind man to see '' ? ?
All I ever wanted was to be a free man in my own country .
I used to love this country and believe that someday we'd win our battle for equality .
"`` I'm still a soldier in a very small way , Styka '' ."
Grabski's shanty was beyond the bridge over the River Bystrzyca near the rail center .
"Grabski sat in a sweat-saturated undershirt , cursing the excessive heat which clamped an uneasy stillness before sundown ."
He was a square brick of a man with a moon-round face and sunken Polish features .
Flies swarmed around the bowl of lentils in which he mopped thick black bread .
I will get you inside the guard camp as a member of my crew .
I don't know if I can get you into the inner camp .
"His broad flat fingers , petrified into massive sausages by years of bricklaying , snatched the bills clumsily ."
`` You get the rest when I'm safely out of Majdanek '' .
`` I ain't taking no goddamned chances for no Jew business '' .
I'd have been more impressed if I hadn't remembered that she'd played Hedda Gabler in her highschool dramatics course .
"`` Nothing's free in the whole goddam world '' , was all I could think of to say ."
When I'd delivered myself of that gem there was nothing to do but order up another drink .
I'd forgotten all about Thelma and the Kentucky Derby and how it was Thelma's fifty dollars I was spending .
Drunk or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me .
`` You know I don't like my men to have other women .
She just about made me carry her upstairs and then she clung to me and wouldn't let me go .
There was a man's jacket on the chair and a straw hat on the table .
The place smelt of some kind of hair lotion these pimplike characters use .
She was still laughing when I grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed .
She lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling me where to look for the coffeepot .
We didn't have time to speak before Eileen's voice was screeching at us from the bed .
`` And don't either of you forget that I'm not any man's property .
"If you want to fight , go down on the sidewalk '' ."
I didn't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone .
"Of course I had to give her Eileen's address , but she never came near us ."
I must know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times .
And there I was shacked up with Eileen in that filthy fourth floor attic on Hudson Street .
I use the phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about our relationship .
He slept in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs .
I said sure that was what I wanted her to do but she paid no attention .
Eileen had a wonderful way of not listening to things she didn't want to hear .
Still I didn't think she was twotiming me with Precious right then .
To be on the safe side I never let Eileen get out of my sight day or night .
I'd thought him a pimp or procurer but he didn't seem to be .
He was smooth and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under his selfeffacing manner .
Whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was Precious who did the work .
The phone had been disconnected but telegrams came for him and notes by special messenger .
`` Connections '' was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when I put leading questions .
"`` Oh he's just an international spy '' , Eileen would shout with her screechy laugh ."
When I was in liquor I rode him pretty hard I guess .
"`` Some day '' , I told Eileen , `` that guy will kill us both '' ."
Getting drunk every night was the only way I could handle the situation .
"The way Eileen and I were hitting it up , we needed ten or fifteen dollars an evening ."
I don't know what we would have done if Pat O'Dwyer hadn't come to town .
Those O'Dwyers had that Irish clannishness that made them stick together in spite of politics and everything .
Now it would be up to me to keep the little girl out of mischief .
How about me trying to help her get her job back ? ?
All evening Eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready for her first communion .
When we separated that evening Pat pushed a hundred dollar bill into Eileen's hand to help towards a layette .
Before he left town Pat saw to it that I was fixed up with a job .
A friend of Pat's named Frank Sposato had just muscled into the Portwatchers' Union .
It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the thieving is awful in the port of New York .
One reason the portwatchers let Sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen .
With my gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance I certainly looked the honest working stiff .
"There was one fact which Rector could not overlook , one truth which he could not deny ."
It was only natural that Fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decisions .
How foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice .
His first move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days .
In all of his experience in the mission field Rector had never seen a convert quite like Hino .
Rector had never been able to find out much about Hino's past .
"Putting the pieces of this mosaic together , Rector had the vague outlines of a biography ."
"If and when Hino decided to tell him about his experiences , he would do so unasked ."
He was surprised to find Kayabashi's secretary on the other end of the line .
They had never seen one before and had expressed a curiosity about it .
When would the oyabun like to bring his guests up here '' ? ?
`` At three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time '' .
"`` I beg to inquire if the back is now safe for travelers '' , he said ."
The secretary sighed with relief and then the telephone clicked in Rector's hand .
Fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn .
"He went into the print shop , where Fletcher had just finished cleaning the press ."
"`` I should say about a hundred thousand '' , Fletcher said ."
Fletcher nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange the things Rector requested .
"Rector's next stop was at the schoolroom , where Mavis was monitoring a test ."
He beckoned to her from the door and she slipped quietly outside .
I want to create the impression of a compound full of children .
`` I've adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water gets too low .
It was going to take a lot of activity to fill it .
"`` You are about to become a first-class surveyor '' , Rector said ."
Rector was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential hall .
She concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient .
Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose .
At their meeting he told her not to bother about `` where '' -- he would attend to that .
"She sang him Scott's charming ballad `` Rosabelle '' , which was the vogue of the moment ."
"`` Your voice is delightful '' , he approved with a warm smile ."
`` Tomorrow will be a new experience -- I have never before made love to a nightingale .
"Each wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this , it seems , was not employed for self-flagellation ."
The jaded amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish .
Charming and peaceful -- but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure ? ?
She was the pursuer as clearly as was Venus in Shakespeare's poem .
"And while her Adonis did not suffer from inexperience , satiety might well be an equal handicap ."
"No , she would not pretend modesty , but neither must she be crudely bold ."
"So , not only had he been here before , but it seemed he might well come again ."
"Claire felt suddenly small and cheap , heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous history of Don Juan ."
So don't see yourself as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event of major importance '' .
"`` The gods seemed to think sex pretty important '' , she rebutted ."
"`` So you know something of the classics , do you '' ? ?"
"`` Tell me about Minerva , how she behaved , what she did to please you '' ."
"I don't ask you who 'tis you're being unfaithful to , husband or lover ."
"`` Very well '' , she said , `` I'll not catechize you ."
What matter the others so long as I have my place in history '' .
"He drew her close and , hand on cheek , turned her face to his ."
His hand went to her shoulder and pushed aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown ; ;
"then , to better purpose , he took hold of the knot and with dextrous fingers , untied it ."
"But , kindled by his kiss , his caressing hand , her desire was aflame ."
When Claire returned to Bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become Byron's mistress .
"`` If he would only leave the East '' , said Mary ."
"`` The hero of his next poem is Napoleon Bonaparte '' , said Claire , with slightly overdone carelessness ."
"`` I was told it on good authority '' , Claire answered darkly ."
"`` I mustn't tell , I mustn't tell '' , she repeated to herself ."
"winter came , and with it Mary's baby -- a boy as she had wished ."
With a pardonable irony Shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his daughter :
"Shelley sent a copy to Southey , a former friend , and another to Godwin ."
Not a thought nor a cadence was missed in her summary of appreciation .
"`` You have made the labor worth while '' , he said to her , smiling ."
There will be thousands who will thrill to the loveliness of Alastor .
"`` Poor Mr. Thynne , he always has to be trotted out for my encouragement '' ."
Mary's supercritical attitude toward Byron had nothing to do with his moral disrepute .
She was resentful of his easy success as compared with Shelley's failure .
The careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent .
"The previous scandals , gaily diverting as they were , had only served to increase his popularity ."
But the liaison successfully started in the last days of autumn was now languishing .
"Byron , since the separation from his wife had been living in a smallish house in Piccadilly Terrace ."
"Despite his yearning , the colonel would not go down to see the men come through the lines ."
"He would remain in the tent , waiting impatiently , occupied by some trivial task ."
-- Fetch me the copies of everything B and C companies have requisitioned in the last six months .
"The colonel crouched tensely on one of the folding chairs , methodically tearing at his thumbnail ."
The bombproof was a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timbers covered with earth .
"From the outside , it seemed no more than a low drumlin , a lump on the dark earth ."
"The place smelled strongly of rank , fertile earth , rotting wood and urine ."
At least the Union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle .
"He stood stiffly erect , clutching the staff , his body half hidden by the limp cloth ."
"The man had come floundering aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last instant , brandishing the flag of truce ."
"Someone had hauled him over the side , and he had remained silent while they crossed ."
An officer with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank .
Watson had nodded absently and muttered that he would check the lists himself later .
"The men he would take back across the river stood there , but he turned away from them ."
"He had hoped to be alone in the bombproof , but the soldier had followed him ."
"Though Watson carefully ignored the man , he could not deny his presence ."
"Perhaps it would be better to speak to him , since silence could not exorcise his form ."
"Watson glanced briefly at him , seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner ."
"If my pass is approved , I may be a half hour ."
"The soldier answered in a curious , muffled voice , his lips barely moving ."
Watson turned away and did not see the man's knees buckle and his body sag .
"He paced slowly , stooping , staring at the damp , slippery floor ."
"He stopped pacing , leaned against the dank , timbered wall and let his mind drift ."
He grew annoyed and at the same time surprised at that emotion .
"Prompted by a guilty urge , he had disobeyed the order of a man he respected ."
"The figure in the corner belched loudly , a deep , liquid eruption ."
"To his left , the two skiffs dented their sharp bows into the soft bank ."
"They were stocky men , well fed and clean-shaven , with neat uniforms and sturdy boots ."
"The thin gray figures raised a hoarse , cawing cry like the call of a bird flock ."
"They moved toward the skiffs with shocking eagerness , elbowing and shoving ."
"Four men were knocked down , but did not attempt to rise ."
Watson watched two of them flounder into the shallow water and listened to their voices beg shrilly .
"He swayed like a drunkard , his arms milling in slow circles ."
"He paced forward unsteadily , leaning too far back , his head tilted oddly ."
"he crept in an incertain manner , patting the ground before him ."
"Still the guards did not move , but stood inert , aloof from the slow-scrambling man ."
"The man began to creep in the wrong direction , deceived by a slight rise in the ground ! !"
He turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart .
"The guards lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at Watson with sullen , puzzled faces ."
He reached down and closed his fingers on the man's upper arm .
"Beneath his clutch , a flat strip of muscle surged on the bone ."
"Light sticks of fingers , the tips gummy with dark earth , patted at Watson's throat ."
-- Henry said that he'd take my arm and get me right there .
"How far could it be , Watson thought bleakly , how far can a blind man crawl ? ?"
Another body length or all the rest of his nighted life ? ?
"The man wheezed weakly , his fetid breath beating softly against Watson's neck ."
"The man swayed on a thwart , turning his ruined eyes from side to side ."
"Watson turned away , sickened for the first time in many months ."
What a fool he had been to think of his brother ! !
"What had he thought of , to go to John , grovel and beg understanding ? ?"
"Men were slaughtered every day , tumbled into eternity like so many torn parcels flung down a portable chute ."
What made him think John had a right to witness his brother's humiliation ? ?
Now he knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own suffering .
"It was built by the Pasterns , and stands on the acre of ground that adjoins our property ."
"Sitting on her terrace , sitting in her parlor , sitting anywhere , she ground an axe of self-esteem ."
Let's throw a little nuclear hardware at them and show them who's boss '' .
The clear and searching sweep of sun on the lawns was like a climax of the year's lights .
"Leaves were burning somewhere and the smoke smelled , for all its ammoniac acidity , of beginnings ."
The boundless blue air was stretched over the zenith like the skin of a drum .
"Leaving her house one late afternoon , Mrs. Pastern stopped to admire the October light ."
"Mrs. Pastern had been given sixteen names , a bundle of literature , and a printed book of receipts ."
It was her work to go among her neighbors and collect their checks .
"Charity as she knew it was complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof she saw signified charity ."
Mrs. Horowitz was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat .
"Mrs. Pastern had telephoned most of her neighbors in advance , and most of them were ready for her ."
She experienced none of the suspense of some poor stranger selling encyclopedias .
Here and there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of sherry .
"She stopped at the Surcliffes' after dusk , and had a Scotch-and-soda ."
`` I did everybody on my list but the Blevins and the Flannagans .
"`` But I don't know the Flannagans '' , Charlie Pastern said ."
"`` Nobody does , but they gave me ten last year '' ."
their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door .
"Turning in at the Flannagans' driveway , he tried to remember if he had ever met them ."
"The name encouraged him , because he always felt that he could handle the Irish ."
"Won't you step into the living room , where it's cozier '' ? ?"
"`` I'll have a drink , then , if you'll have one with me '' ."
"`` Sit down '' , he said , `` and enjoy your drink and look for your checkbook later ."
She would rather live in danger than die of loneliness and boredom .
"`` I've seen you , though , before '' , she said with enormous coyness , patting his knee ."
`` I've seen you walking your dogs on Sunday and driving by in the convertible .
"Sheer plumpness , he knew , is not a vital part of the body and has no procreative functions ."
It serves merely as an excess cushion for the rest of the carcass .
"`` I've never done this before '' , she said later , when he was arranging himself to leave ."
"He didn't doubt her truthfulness , although he had heard the words a hundred times ."
"`` I've never done this before '' , they always said , pouring another whiskey ."
"`` I've never done this before '' , they always said , putting on their stockings ."
Charlie ate some supper in the kitchen and went into the TV room to hear the news .
"He thought first of his son and daughter , away at college ."
It was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known .
"His worries harried him up out of bed , and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window ."
In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves .
Children walking home from school would scuff through what seemed to be his foliage .
But there was a look about her mouth as though she were tasting lemons .
"She grasped the chair arms and brought her thin body upright , like a bird alert for flight ."
To Abel : `` I am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here .
I should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your daughters .
Then she went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water .
She looked at the girl speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years ; ;
Angelina placed the tray on the table and with a flick of dark wrist drew off the cloth .
"She smiled , and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face ."
"`` That will be so nice for you , Mrs. Packard '' , she said ."
"`` Um '' , said the old lady , and brought her eyes down to the tray ."
"Then she looked at the old woman again , her eyes calm ."
"`` Yes '' , she said , `` I remember that they came here every summer ."
"I used to play with the older one sometimes , when he'd let me ."
For an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through her smile .
Then Angelina turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen .
For a moment she held her face to the empty doorway ; ;
"She swung her eyes up to the blue of the window , her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans ."
"It could have been anyone's infant , for it had not survived the bassinet ."
Each successive movement in his growing was recorded on the unreeling film inside her .
It was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea .
"The brothers drove down together in Mark's small red sports car , Mark at the wheel ."
"He saw the land with a stranger's eyes , all the old familiarness gone ."
"And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger , impervious , complete in itself ."
"There was stability there , too -- a color which his life had had once ."
In the stiff neutral lines of the telephone poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of Aunt Jessica's letter .
"What bad grace , what incredible selfishness he and Mark had shown ."
"They had closed over , absolutely , with the sealing of old Izaak's grave ."
"The old woman , stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took on an ominous reality ."
"His sandy hair was already beginning to thin and recede at the sides , and Abel looked quickly away ."
"Mark easily looked years older than himself , settled , his world comfortably categorized ."
"`` She didn't mention bringing Myra '' , Mark said , maneuvering the car into the next lane ."
"`` She's probably getting old -- crotchety , I mean -- and we figured uh-uh , better not ."
The air took on a special strength now that they'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind .
"Meeting it without preparation as they did , robbed of anticipation , a common disappointment seized them ."
I didn't hurry though it was cold and the Pedersen kid was in the kitchen .
He always slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach him .
I knew better but I was thinking of the Pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough .
"I didn't say anything , trying to get my throat clear , but I watched him ."
He was like a mean horse to come at from the rear .
He was shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow .
"He was about to get up so I got out , slamming the door ."
Once he went after Hans and dumped his pot over the banister .
He didn't even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part of Pa's door down before he stopped .
He might not have gone that far if Pa hadn't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house .
That pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it .
"`` Listen to me , Jorge , I've had enough to your sassing ."
"He don't care at all , and I don't care to get my head busted neither ."
All he cares about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face .
Ma never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off .
"`` Yes , Hans , if they're needed '' , Ma said ."
Hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her .
"If we had , then one of us would have had to go instead ."
I took the pail and shovel and went out on the porch .
He was put out too because there was only one way of understanding what she'd done .
But he'd find out about this one because we were using it .
"He didn't figure her at all , and if he found out a woman it'd be bad ."
"That's what he needs , something warm to his skin , don't he '' ? ?"
There was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received ; ;
"His files , desk , drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos ."
He left his home the day after New Year's wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and without a hat .
"He had a deep voice which was full of good food she had cooked , and good humor ; ;"
"She called , trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure ."
She stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road .
"There is a death in all partings , she knew , and promptly put it out of her mind ."
"They were both so young , after all , so unready for any final parting ."
"How could it have been thirty years already , she wondered ? ?"
"But they all said , `` No , your time will come ."
"People died , she would have said , in hospitals , or in cars on the highway at night ."
"Bobby Joe was gone all day now , not coming in for dinner and sometimes not for supper ."
"Thus a new pattern of days began to develop , for Granny Albright did not die ."
"She lay still on the bed , her head hardly denting the pillow ; ;"
"sometimes she opened her eyes and looked around , and sometimes she took a little milk or soup ."
"They stopped expecting her to die the next minute , but only in the next day or two ."
"but they might as well unpack their suitcases , for she might linger on ."
"There was not anything she could do there , but that was where everyone was , or would be ."
"Bobby Joe and the boys would come by , say `` How's Granny '' ? ?"
"The evaporative cooler had been moved to Granny's room , and her door was kept shut ; ;"
"She filled a big pitcher and set it , with glasses , on a tray ."
"`` She married our baby boy , Bobby Joe , this summer '' ."
"This joke was not funny to Linda Kay , and she blushed , as she always did ; ;"
"then , hearing the muffled boom of Howard's laughter , blushed redder ."
He got in the oil business out at Odessa and lucked into some money '' .
"`` Listen , I never had a chance to kill an antelope ."
`` Did he ever visit here when he was a kid '' ? ?
Almost immediately Howard and his daughter Debora drove up in the Cadillac .
"There was really no reason to refuse , and Linda Kay had never ridden in a Cadillac ."
"It was easy to see that they were made for each other , and they knew what they wanted ."
"Bobby Joe would be a senior this year , and he planned to graduate ."
`` I'd give anything if I could have found a girl like you '' .
Bobby Joe was trying to get Linda Kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home .
"`` Why , I couldn't even cook a piece of antelope steak ; ;"
"I want to roast the whole thing , and have it for the boys '' ."
Linda Kay felt like going off to the bedroom to cry ; ;
"It was full-of-the-moon ( or a little past ) , and nearly light as day ."
That night the older men got to talking about going possum-hunting on a moonlight night .
"After they had left , some of the people moved around , to find more comfortable places to sit ."
"Still she was not sorry he sat by her , but in fact was flattered ."
"He had become the center of the company , such stories he had to tell ."
He had sold oil stock to Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in person ; ;
he had helped fight an oil-well fire that raged six days and nights .
"`` But tell me , doctor , where do you plan to conduct the hatching '' ? ?"
"`` That will have to be in the hotel '' , the doctor retorted , confirming Alex's anticipations ."
"`` This is my hen ledger '' , he informed him in an absorbed way ."
A knocking at Alex's door roused him at six o'clock the following morning .
and hopes that the chambermaid and patronne would still be abed began to rise in Alex's well exercised breast .
"`` Bonjour , messieurs , vous etes matinals '' , she greeted them pleasantly ."
`` Vous voulez vos petits dejeuners tout de suite alors '' ? ?
"With that he hurried up the stairs , followed by her suspicious gaze ."
The spectacle progressed towards a denouement which was obviously still remote ; ;
"`` That was the fille de chambre , the one you thought couldn't get the eggs out ."
Anyhow she's coming back in five minutes to do the room '' .
he rose to put his greatcoat on and addressed Alex in a muted voice .
"they climbed the stairs which creaked , very loudly to their sensitive ears , and reached the next floor ."
At the door Alex managed to persuade the increasingly astonished fille de chambre to return in ten minutes .
the halls were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine and listened at the door .
A bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows being arranged indicated the fille de chambre's presence inside ; ;
they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced another important fact .
Alex suppressed those expressions of relief which offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat ; ;
Alex nodded to the maid as though nothing unusual were taking place and entered the doctor's room .
But he knew how important it was for her to keep her figure .
"In the kitchen , Leona , his little young wife , was reading the morning paper ."
Her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool .
"`` Here '' , Winston said gently , `` what's these dishes doing not washed '' ? ?"
`` If I catch you one more time down here without stockings '' --
`` To Be Left Behind '' was printed at the top in Miss Ada ; ;
`` I thought you was sick to death of this big house .
"Said you wore yourself out , cleaning all these empty rooms '' ."
`` What room is there going to be in an apartment for any child '' ? ?
"-- and flounced to the sink , where she began noisily to wash her hands ."
"Although it had seemed a good reason , to begin with : no couple could afford to have children ."
`` How you going to work with a child hanging on you '' ? ?
"`` You want to keep this job , don't you '' ? ?"
"She made him sad some days , and he was never sure why ; ;"
"`` I've been bursting my lungs for you '' , Mr. Jack complained ."
"He was standing in front of the mirror , tightening his tie ."
"`` I don't know what you think you've been doing about my clothes '' , he said ."
Winston took the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work .
"he brushed his shoulders and his back and his collar with long , firm strokes ."
Mr. Jack cried when the brush tipped his hat down over his eyes .
"Then he stood back to look at Mr. Jack , who was pulling on his pigskin gloves ."
"`` Good-by , Winston '' , Mr. Jack said , giving a final set to his hat ."
"After Mr. Jack drove away , Winston went on looking out the window ."
He noticed a speck of dirt on the sill and swiped at it with his finger .
"Ten years ago , he had come to the house to be interviewed ."
"Miss Ada had been out back , in a straw hat , planting flowers ."
"She had had a dignity about her , even barefoot and almost too tan ."
"Since then , the flowers she had planted had spread all over the hill ."
"And the dogwood in early May , for Miss Ada's alfresco party ; ;"
"Still , he couldn't help thinking , we're all getting old , getting small ; ;"
"`` Winston '' , she said , `` get the basket for the breakables '' ."
"she had on her Easter suit , blue , with lavender binding ."
"Halfway across the house , he could have smelled her morning perfume ."
"It hung in all her day clothes , sweet and strong ; ;"
"sometimes when he was pressing , Winston raised her dresses to his face ."
"She smiled at Winston , and he saw the hateful hard glitter in her eyes ."
"`` At least you could leave it for the movers '' , Miss Ada said ."
`` What possessed you to tell me a clotheshorse would be a good idea '' ? ?
"`` She's been talking about a picture '' , Winston had told him ."
Winston had heard because he was setting up the liquor tray in the next room .
"Through the door , he had seen Mr. Jack walking around , waiting for Miss Ada ."
Winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown .
"Mr. Jack had said , `` You look about fifteen years old '' ."
"Miss Ada had giggled , and she went sweeping and rustling to the couch and sank down ."
"`` You look like that picture I have at the office '' , Mr. Jack had started ."
"`` I'll give you a medical certificate , framed , if you like '' , Miss Ada had said ."
After that they had sat for five minutes without saying a word .
"Then Miss Ada had stood up , rustling and rustling , and gone upstairs ."
In my letters I took on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real life .
"As it turned out , Jessica took matters into her own hands ."
"Having received permission to give a camp reunion-Halloween party , she asked that I come and be her date ."
"I went and , mum and nervous , all but made a fool of myself ."
"I remember standing in a corner , watching Jessica act the hostess , serving soft drinks to her guests ."
"We blushed and were flustered , and it turned out to be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek ."
"Later , we agreed to think of how we wished to spend that night ."
"But though I boasted and gave off a dapper front , I was beneath it all frightened ."
It would be the first time I had ever been completely alone with a girl I loved .
Should I bring along a corsage or send one to her ? ?
Was it preferable to meet her at home or in the city ? ?
Was I supposed to buy a funny hat and a rattle for Jessica ? ?
I looked over their faces and felt a twinge : they all looked so much more knowing than I .
Suppose the lines in front of the movie houses were too long and we couldn't get in ? ?
Suppose her father had changed his mind and had refused to let her leave ? ?
Suppose at this very moment her father was calling my house in an effort to cancel the plans ? ?
"An interne , a nurse and two attendants were in charge of us ."
"I felt lonely and depressed as I stared out the bus window at Chicago's grim , dirty West Side ."
We had become good friends during my stay at Cook County Hospital .
She knew also that I was unmarried and without a single known relative .
"`` I read those newspaper stories about you '' , she had said ."
"`` Would it make any difference to you if I were , Mary Jane '' ? ?"
`` I wouldn't have gone into nursing if I didn't care about people .
"When I think of people like you , well , I '' --"
"`` Oh , yes '' , I said , feeling annoyed , `` she was very pretty ."
"You don't believe that I'm going back to medical school and finish , do you '' ? ?"
It's not a joke to be sent to a place like this or to Hanover .
"`` That's what I mean about you , Anderson '' , she said ."
My father's a policeman and makes less than seven thousand dollars a year .
"There was no money for tuition , for clothes , for all the things you apparently take for granted ."
"`` That's none of your business '' , she said , then changed the subject ."
"`` My father and mother died when I was two years old '' , I said ."
"Her eyes became bright as she talked about her father and mother , aunts and uncles , cousins ."
"Listening , I felt cheated and lonely as only an orphan can ."
`` Your dad sounds like a good father and a good policeman .
`` My father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached to Homicide for five years .
What about your that girl you were going to kill '' ? ?
I can say this : I'm dead serious about going back to school .
"As for that other girl , let's just say that I never want to see her again ."
"You will get to come home on long weekends from Hanover , won't you '' ? ?"
"`` We'll go up to the Edgewater Beach Hotel for dinner '' , I said ."
"`` I like to dance '' , she said , then turned and walked away ."
It was unlikely that any girl as sharp as Mary Jane Brennan would believe it without proof .
"Perhaps this was reality and Dale Nelson , the actor , was delusion ; ;"
I had come to Chicago from New York early in September with a dramatic production called Ask Tony .
"No one , not even the producer , had any real hope of getting it back to Broadway ."
Ask Tony was doomed from the moment Kupcinet leveled on it in his Sun-Times column .
Out of the entire cast I alone received good notices for my portrayal of a psychopathic killer .
We were paid off Tuesday morning and given tickets back to New York .
I felt lonely and depressed as I packed my bags at the Croydon Hotel .
It seemed to me that my life was destined to be one brilliant failure after another .
It seemed to me that I was not only unlucky but quite stupid as well .
`` Why don't you bastards lay off for a while '' ? ?
"I'm calling you , Mr. Nelson , at the request of Mr. Phillip Wycoff ."
His car could pick you up at your hotel at twelve '' .
"I started to say something else appropriate , but the man had hung up ."
I laid a tenspot on the bar and motioned to the bartender to serve a round .
He had just returned my change when the doorman came in off the street to page me .
`` Mr. Wycoff's car is waiting for you at the east entrance '' .
He gave me a ticket on the agency car and parked it .
"`` Forgot to get something out of the car '' , I told him , showing him my ticket ."
"You're conscious of the fact that your feet hurt , that the city pavements are hard ."
I waited a solid two hours before my man came out of the office building .
I wasn't far behind him when he entered the parking lot and hurried over to his car .
"The attendant recognized me once more and said , `` What did you do about that office '' ? ?"
"`` I haven't made up my mind yet '' , I said ."
one here and one that's out quite a ways where there's usually curb parking '' .
"`` That curb parking is undependable and annoying , particularly when it rains '' , he said ."
"`` I'll have one of the boys get it '' , he said ."
"`` Make it as snappy as you can , will you '' ? ?"
You don't want to lease a place way out in the sticks .
"You get business where the business is , not where it isn't '' ."
I was held up a bit trying to make a left turn .
"I turned on the electric bug , and the signal came in loud and clear ."
"If it ever got behind me , the beep turned to a buzz ."
After a while the signal became a buzz and I knew he was behind me .
"I found a parking place half a block away , sat in the car and waited ."
My lights would have been a giveaway if I'd tried to shadow him in the conventional manner .
"Moreover , I'd have lost him if it hadn't been for the electronic shadowing device ."
His signal was coming loud and clear and then all of a sudden it turned to a buzz .
I circled the block and found he was in the parking lot of a high-class restaurant .
I sat where I could watch the exit and realized I was hungry .
It was a fairly modern motel with quite a bit of electrical display in front .
The card the man I was shadowing had filled out was still on the counter .
The manager of the motel was a woman who apparently didn't care .
`` Your wife isn't going to join you -- later '' ? ?
There are ice cubes in a container at the far end and in another by the office .
I put a small electric amplifier against the wall on the side I wanted to case .
"Whoever his companion was going to be , she was going to join him later ."
I was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of communication had been severed .
I had noticed a drive-in down the road a quarter of a mile .
"`` There may not be any women left '' , I said ."
"She gave a little pout and said , `` I don't get off work until eleven o'clock ."
"I said `` Darn it , that's the automatic signal that shows when the ignition key is on ."
`` Don't you think it's selfish to have dinner before you go to pick her up '' ? ?
"`` Not a bit '' , I said , `` but she's keeping her figure in hand '' ."
"The fat man said , `` All we gotta do is go around the corner '' ."
"`` It says water works , but there is a policeman on duty , too '' ."
He was going to be sensible and not try to do anything rash with that gun pointed at him .
There was a small sideboard with some empty beer bottles on it and perhaps fifteen wooden chairs .
The distance between where she stood and where Dave waited at the outside door was a hundred miles .
The thin man moved swiftly to the phone and dialed a number .
He turned from the phone and strode to the front of the restaurant .
"A line of worry formed , a twitch pulled his mouth over to one side ."
You ain't kidding me -- the kid don't know the name of this town '' ? ?
She musta been walking in her sleep -- you seen her yourself in here '' .
`` Remember how she looked when Barney held the door for her ? ?
She was just waking up when we found her at the garage '' .
`` Stupid fools -- ain't got enough brains between the two of you '' --
"Grosse muttered , his head down , one hand playing with the zipper on his jacket ."
"The heavy glass didn't break , but the top flew off ; ;"
"Not really startled , but careful to appear so , Grosse sucked noisily on his pipe ."
Grosse quietly got a broom and started to sweep up the sugar .
"His mouth worked over the profanity , the obscenities in his vocabulary ."
He returned the menu to its place between catchup bottle and paper napkin dispenser .
"He ran a finger down his cheek , tracing the scratch there ."
`` Why can't I leave her locked up in the tool crib '' ? ?
The thin man stopped his pacing long enough to glance at the clock .
`` You and Barney get her over to Rose's before it gets too light .
"After Guardino's left , we'll dump the kid somewhere near the border where she kin get home ."
`` What am I going to do with her all day ? ?
Just get her where Guardino won't see her and start asking questions '' .
`` Are you a poor dumb Canadian or a smart aleck from the States '' ? ?
"Vince lifted his hand as if to strike , but his thin lips spread in a smile ."
And I ain't going back there on account of one lousy kid '' .
She blew her nose on a tissue and opened the coke bottle .
The man was busy doing something to the inside of the door-frame on the driver's side of a car .
"She said , `` Barney , why is he keeping me here '' ? ?"
He seemed to be looking at a point above the little window .
Or borrow some money from someone and go home by bus ? ?
He dropped it and carefully ground it to nothing with the sole of his heavy shoe .
How could he be kind one moment and cruel the next ? ?
Did he know something that made him feel sad and sorry for her ? ?
And was he afraid to do anything as definite as releasing her ? ?
the unknown was so much worse than -- what dangers lay ahead for her ? ?
What awful thing had she to face in the next few hours ? ?
With a sturdy act of will she turned her mind away from herself ; ;
In her mind she followed the white Buick along the road somewhere between here and the Niagara River .
"Then he would yawn and stretch and shout , `` All out ."
Roberta Landis put her hand on her husband's arm as he slid in the driver's seat beside her .
Her teeth chattered so that she made three attempts at speech before she became intelligible .
There was a wet spot -- she couldn't have been gone long '' .
"She stammered , `` You heard what he said about police ? ?"
I can sit here in the car while you walk around the corner '' .
"As he chewed his gum and exuded wheezing breath , Marty smelt the reek of bad whiskey ."
He had driven the car that passed them on the road outside Admassy's place .
"Marty smiled at Squire pleasantly and said , `` There was a cab waiting for me here ."
"Squire chewed his gum , his jaw moving in a steady rhythm ."
"Marty scanned the faces of the others nearest him , looked into their staring eyes ."
He avoided showing any surprise or annoyance when no one answered him .
"`` I have to get back to Jarrodsville '' , he went on ."
I wonder if one of you gentlemen could drive me back to town ? ?
"I'd be happy to pay for the favor , of course '' ."
The seventeen men stood and stared at him for a moment longer .
"They piled into the waiting cars , motors roared , the cars sped off ."
Marty Land stood alone on a red-clay road as storm clouds gathered ominously in the sky again .
Across the road there was one no more than a hundred yards away .
Not a single strand of wire reached into the silent houses beside the red-clay road .
Marty faced east and started walking down the left side of the road .
For just an instant he thought of appealing to them for help .
Perhaps they had a car or truck and would drive him into town .
He was trapped on the road when he heard the sound of an approaching car .
That had only been a ruse to lure him out on the deserted road .
"A second car was coming from the west , from the direction of Sanford's Run ."
"It was a narrow road , barely wide enough for two cars to pass ."
He could not leave the road because of the water-filled drainage ditch .
"As the two cars roared by , there was a high-pitched eerie , nerve-shattering sound ."
"For moments he stood in water , shivering and gasping for breath ."
"The cars , with their load of howling men , had disappeared in the distance ."
"There had been two more cars parked at the farm , a Plymouth and a pickup truck ."
"They would be coming for him next , bearing down on him from both directions ."
And then the station wagon and the Ford would seek him out again .
That way was barred on both sides of the road by a high barbed-wire fence .
At least he could climb up on the fence when his tormenters roared by again .
There was even a bare chance that the phone had not been disconnected .
"He was deep in water , but at least they could not reach him there ."
"He climbed back to the road , and he felt utterly exhausted ."
"And then he saw something that he had not seen before , and panic gripped him again ."
"He lurched on down the road despairingly , because there was no place else to go ."
You could not stand on dignity when you were soaked and muddied and your life was at stake .
"He broke into a dogtrot , breathing heavily , streaming with sweat ."
The fences on both sides of the road bristled with the barbed wire .
"The Plymouth was coming at him from the east , the pickup truck from the west ."
The cars must have had their gas pedals pushed down to the floor boards .
He held his arms close to his sides and made himself as small as possible .
"When the Plymouth neared , it veered toward him and seemed about to run him down ."
"If he moved , he would be in the path of the other car ."
He thought the fender of the Plymouth brushed his jacket as it went by .
In a fraction of a second the pickup truck hurtled by on the other side .
"The weird , insane sound of the Rebel yell reverberated again and echoed from the distant hills ."
"`` Oh , no , not again '' , he said aloud ."
"There was a new sound , a sound as piercing as the Rebel yell , yet different ."
"Now he saw that the approaching car was painted white , and he began to wave his arms frantically ."
"He staggered into the back seat and lay back , fighting for breath ."
"Pete turned around and said to Marty , `` I guess you think I'm a yellow-bellied hound ."
"If I'd stayed , all that I'd have got was four punctured tires and one busted head ."
The sheriff was occupied with maneuvering the car around in a very narrow space .
"When it was finally pointed east , he said , `` You should never have come out here alone ."
Every man in every one of these houses is a Night Rider .
"He listened a moment and then said , `` Hold it '' ."
"That wasn't too far from Fifth Street , and should allow him to make Scotty's Bar by midnight ."
"`` I don't know what you're getting into , Mike '' , he said unhappily ."
"Shayne said briskly , `` Grab another drink if you want it ."
We've got one other call to make before I meet Alvarez '' .
Rourke hastily slopped whiskey into his glass on top of half-melted ice-cubes .
"He went to a closet to get a light jacket , and took his hat from beside the door ."
"At least , I want to find out whether she's home yet or not '' ."
`` That story of hers about an unsigned note directing her to be there tonight sounds completely phony .
`` Do you think Laura did have the counterfeit bracelet made without her husband's knowledge '' ? ?
"Rourke could see it better out the right-hand side , and he said , `` yes ."
"Turn to the left , I think , for that number you gave me ."
Shayne got in the left-hand lane and cut across the Boulevard divider .
A single automobile was parked half-way up the block on the left-hand side .
"Instead of pulling into the curb , Shayne increased his speed slightly to the corner where he swung left ."
"He went around the corner and parked , turning off his lights and motor ."
"`` I told you , Mike '' , said Rourke in an aggrieved voice ."
`` Did you see the car parked across the street '' ? ?
I got a quick look at their faces as we went past .
`` The pair whom Petey is officially commending for slapping me around and pulling me in '' .
Maybe with specific orders to see that I don't make contact with her .
I'll slide out and walk around the block back to the cocktail lounge on Biscayne .
You drive on and circle back and pull up beside them parked there .
"You're a reporter , and you're looking for Miss Perrin to interview her ."
"If they are Beach cops on a stake-out , they'll admit it to a reporter ."
The reporter nodded as he moved up beside him at the bar .
I made them show me their identification before I could be persuaded not to call on Felice Perrin '' .
"Shayne said happily , `` I've got it all worked out , Tim ."
"In exactly three minutes , go in that phone booth behind you and call Police Headquarters ."
Then hang up fast and come walking on down to the Perrin address .
The bartender brought Rourke's drink and Shayne laid a twenty-dollar bill on the bar .
"He said in a low voice , `` I've got a date with a lady , Mister ."
"You know how it is '' , he added with a conspiratorial wink ."
He went swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two Beach detectives in the front seat .
Shayne locked his big hands around Harris' thin neck and dragged him out over the seat into the roadway .
He hit him once on the sharp point of his chin and felt the body go limp .
A row of mailboxes along the wall had numbers and names on them .
"He looked down over the banister at the hotel desk , with the telephone and pen set ."
"If I could call in , they could check the story while we were on our way ."
"Then he heard it , like a muffled thud , felt a subtle change in air pressure ."
He gasped for air and the impact tore his hand from the rail .
"He tumbled with Roberts , helpless and in agony , over and over , down the steps ."
"When his vision cleared he saw the taller one scrambling upward , reaching ."
Mickey was on his knees when Roberts turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand .
He felt his empty pocket and knew that Roberts had retrieved the only weapon at hand .
"Mickey's eyes fixed on the other's feet , which would first betray the moment and direction of an attack ."
`` You want to be that big a fool -- I was hoping for this '' .
Roberts brushed at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps .
`` Or would it be easier if I put my hands in my pockets '' ? ?
"He advanced slowly , directly , giving no hint of a feint to either side ."
"Mickey backed off two steps , forcing him to come on again ."
"There was a fixed grin on Roberts' face , made hideous by the swollen nose and the smeared blood ."
Mickey felt his shoulders come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door .
"Mickey's guts twisted with the effort , but he kept his eye on the weapon ."
"It moved in a silver arc toward his throat , then veered downward ."
"Ducking , Mickey tripped and fell to one side , landing heavily on the wood floor ."
He felt it rip at the side of his jacket and a momentary sting under his left ribs .
"Still clutching the razor , Roberts came up into a crouch , shaking his head ."
"With his right fist , and nearly all his weight behind it , he smashed at the bloodstained face ."
"The sound of his head striking the solid wood was an ultimate , sudden-end sound ."
"He fell on his side across the lowest step , rolled over once , then lay still ."
"Mickey found himself leaning against the desk , with stiff hands , panting for breath ."
"After a minute he went to Roberts , looked at one of his eyes and felt for a pulse ."
It seemed to him that a long time had passed before he decided what to do .
"The local law here would hold me till they check clear back home , and maybe more than that ."
"Walking away on impulse , he might logically leave behind what it was inconvenient to carry ."
He went to the room he had rented and got into his overcoat .
He left the rest of his things and returned to the lobby .
"He set Roberts' suitcase near the front door , went outside and walked back to the garage ."
"It snowed softly , silently , an undulating interruption of his vision against the night sky ."
"He found the key to the Jeep , got it started and warmed it up for five minutes ."
He went into the hotel and searched till he found the razor .
He took the suitcase out to the Jeep and put it in the front seat .
He got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down to the Jeep .
He drove carefully in the direction of the brief tour they had taken earlier .
"When he reached the dip in the woods , he saw that already the earlier ruts were barely discernible ."
The Jeep fought its way through the low spot and got onto higher ground .
He tossed the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around it .
"When the dust settled , he went back to the Jeep and carefully worked Roberts' body onto his shoulder ."
"He stood looking down for a few seconds , then backed up two or three paces from the edge ."
He could feel himself falling in with it and being unable to get out .
"It was a bad place for Roberts to wind up , but Roberts had asked for it ."
He knelt slowly and dumped the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel .
Then he got on his knees and rolled Roberts' body toward the edge .
"He gave it a strong push , heard it slide , then tumble dryly into the hole ."
He got to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the pit .
The body lay in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel floor .
There was little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter .
It wasn't cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact .
He had started to back into the turn when he remembered the razor in his pocket .
"He climbed down , went back into the tunnel and tossed the razor into the pit ."
"It landed on Roberts' sprawled right thigh , poised precariously , then slid off to the ground ."
He went back once more to the Jeep and started the short drive to the hotel .
In the garage he checked the Jeep for signs of the use he had made of it .
He wiped the steering wheel and all the places he might have touched the Jeep .
"He judged her to be a woman of some pride , though not much sense ."
On the highway he relaxed and enjoyed the drive over Lake Pontchartrain and along the coast .
"If there was such a person , I'm afraid she got away with it ."
`` Maybe the society editor would remember a good-looking out-of-town bride '' .
"The editor says that marriages may be made in heaven , but weddings are made in Mrs. Calhoun's columns ."
She'd be sure to remember any bride who was vague about background .
She'd have made a great scientist dedicated to tracking down heredity and environment .
"If you find out anything , come on back here and we'll get started on it '' ."
Tracking down Mrs. Calhoun was like trying to catch up with Paul Revere between Lexington and Concord .
"It turned out that she also sold real estate , cosmetics , and hospital insurance ."
I remember her because she didn't want her picture in the paper .
"But , of course , you couldn't see too well through the veil '' ."
He was a salesman for something or other and must have been transferred .
"He said vaguely , `` Well , it is a little legal matter , but nothing like that '' ."
He hurried across to the courthouse and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving .
"`` Sounds like what you're after '' , he said when Hank had finished ."
"`` Come on , let's hurry down before they lock up for the day '' ."
"`` Mr. Ferrell Hirey Lindsay , chairman of the board of supervisors ."
"Wants to look up something in the newspaper files , so don't lock him in here '' ."
"It latches when you close it , so stay as long as you like '' ."
Carruthers crossed the room to a metal door with an open grillework in the top half .
"`` It's all right to smoke , but make sure your cigarettes are out before you leave ."
"And , of course , you know not to take clippings '' ."
"`` I'll leave the air conditioner on for you , Mr. Ferrell '' , said Hirey ."
`` Don't forget to turn it off and close the door good so it'll latch '' .
An old weakness for burrowing in records rose up to tempt him .
But he pulled away from the irrelevant old volumes and walked around to the newer ones .
Last year's volume was at the top a couple of inches below the ceiling .
Near it was a metal ladder on casters attached to the top shelf .
There was a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride and groom .
The one line on the bride said she was Miss Lisa Carmody from Baton Rouge .
"If Mrs. Black was who he thought she was , Mr. Black's Peerless selling days might well be over ."
"He glanced at his watch , saw it was only seven , and decided to indulge his weakness now ."
"In the middle of the stock market crash , he heard a slight noise in the outer office ."
"He turned around , saw nothing , and decided it must be a mouse ."
"Something else distracted him , yet there was no sound , only tomblike silence ."
"Then he knew it was not sound , but lack of it ."
He jumped up and turned around to see the metal door closing .
It must be coming from an upright heater against the far wall in the supervisors' office .
"Except for those minutes in her room , he had lost touch with her as a reality ."
There would be all the nuisance of contacting someone else to take over .
"`` Time '' , said Angie , and he smiled very sweet and slow at Mr. Skyros ."
"`` Not too much time , because I'll be needing some more myself pretty much right away ."
"I don't want no trouble , you don't want no trouble , nobody wants trouble , Mr. Skyros '' ."
"Dear heaven , no , thought Mr. Skyros , turning away as another man came in ."
He straightened his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand ; ;
"Anything to do with an ace o' spades , bad luck '' ."
Mr. Skyros was not a man who thought very much about moral principles ; ;
"`` I tell you , you want to leave it that way , I don't fool around with it ."
"Denny said stupidly , `` Why , you ain't turning Angie down , are you , Mr. Skyros ? ?"
"I mean , we all figured -- I guess anybody'd figure -- Angie '' --"
"`` Mr. Skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me '' , he said ."
"`` It's O.K. , Denny , everything's O.K. Ain't it , Mr. Skyros '' ? ?"
If Mr. Skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would eventually cause --
"Angie worth his weight in gold right now , but these users , they sometimes went down fast ."
"`` Now you don't want to go talking that way '' , he said ."
"You see , you got to remember , we all got schedules , like any business ! !"
"About nine o'clock , I call and see if you got any ."
"`` Oh , now , I don't know about that much '' , said Mr. Skyros ."
"I bring you the cash , say five hundred for ten decks ."
"`` I do my best '' , said Mr. Skyros earnestly , `` just for you , my friend ."
"This is awkward for everybody , isn't it , we all got to put up with inconvenience sometimes ."
"Not very much later , but when things had settled down a little ."
"She'd be through here , just no time at all -- leave this kind of thing 'way behind ."
"smarter , and wear different kinds of clothes -- she'd be Katharine Ross , just what that sounded like ."
"`` You've give me the wrong change '' , said the customer sharply ."
"He left a note propped on the desk asking her to call him sometime today , and drove home ."
"And it's no good looking at me like that '' , as she wound affectionately around his ankles ."
But she was talking of Emile when she saw the black line of the open door ; ;
She opened it an inch and poked out the keys for me to give you .
Here '' -- She thrust a bundle of keys strung on a thick red cord into Sarah's hand .
`` Not that there's much use in locking up the smokehouse and the storehouse now .
Well -- I'll take it down with me as I go '' .
"At the door she turned back , her Roman nose looking very long now and satiric ."
"She was deeply , horribly sure that Lucien had filled it with opium ."
"She felt cold and hot , sticky and chilly at the same time ."
"Now wait a minute , she told herself , think about it ; ;"
Lucien is not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee .
She had lost a bottle of opium -- but that was on the trip from New Orleans .
"Rilly or Glendora had entered her room while she slept , bringing back her washed clothes ."
It would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor .
"No , he had been surprised , unpleasantly surprised , but surprised ."
Her skin crawled : Lolotte had told Maude that she was in the hall and the door was open .
She began to doubt whether there had been in fact a lethal dose of opium in the cup .
"So suppose somebody only wished to frighten her , so she would leave Honotassa ! !"
She dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense of normal everyday life .
So somebody else knew what would happen to her father's money if she died .
"Rev didn't need to break the wax seal , read the contract and find out ."
"Rev loved Honotassa , it was like a part of his breath and body ; ;"
There was no point either in telling herself again what a fool she'd been .
"`` Too much work this morning , Miss Sarah -- everybody gone like that '' --"
She come to the kitchen and say she take it up to you '' .
"I don't know what we're going to do , Miss Sarah '' ."
"`` We've got to eat '' , Sarah said , curtly , because a chill crawled over her again ."
there were certainly now fewer mouths to feed but there was less to feed them with .
"`` Can't you possibly imagine what life is going to be like , here '' ? ?"
"She sent Glendora back to the house , her basket and her apron laden ."
"She stood for a moment , rain dripping from the trees over her head , thinking of Maude ."
Maude had the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from Sarah's room .
Maude had the cool ruthlessness to do whatever she made up her mind to do .
She couldn't see any reason why Maude would attempt to frighten her .
"Besides , there was something hysterical and silly , something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her ."
Maude was neither hysterical nor silly and Sarah rather doubted if she had ever been childish .
Maude could have shot Emile -- if she'd had a reason to kill him .
"A lighted lamp stood on the table that dusky , drizzling day ."
"And what news , Sarah thought as satirically as Maude might have said it ."
"Everything in the office , the spreading circle of lamplight , the patch of leather in Lolotte's hands ."
"George poised with the tack hammer , the homely , everyday atmosphere , all denied an attempt at murder ."
Her words jumbled together and she all but ran from the office and from the question in Rev's face .
"if she told anyone of the opium it must be Lucien , her husband ."
The homely everyday details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her with their immediate urgency .
"No matter what had happened or hadn't happened , somebody had to see about dinner ."
"Try talking to some of the fellows he works with , friends , anyone ."
"Try to find out how happy he is with his wife , whether he plays around with women ."
"I just don't want to go off half-cocked before picking up Black , that's all '' ."
`` Gilborn says he was in his office all day with her yesterday .
"Also , it's just possible she might know something about Mrs. Gilborn '' ."
`` Remember to tell that to the next corpse you meet '' .
"Conrad hung up and sat on the small telephone-booth bench , massaging his right leg ."
He wondered how long it would be before they had a signed confession from Lionel Black .
"Thirty years' experience let him know , even at this early stage , that Black was his man ."
"He simply walked , not noticing where he was , not caring ."
"The walk ended , inevitably , right in front of his hotel building ."
He crossed the lobby and rode up in the elevator lost in his own thoughts .
There was no evidence that anything was different than it had been .
"Without taking off his coat , he sat in the blue chair which still faced the closed bedroom door ."
"At last , sitting there , in the familiar surroundings , the truth began to sink in ."
"He felt no anger towards Kitti , no sense that she had betrayed him ."
"She was all he had , everything he had , everything he wanted ."
Gilborn wondered whether Kitti had lain in that same bed with Who ? ?
"Before leaving , he took one last , lingering look at the apartment ."
"In the street , walking as quickly as he could , Stanley Gilborn was a lone figure ."
"On Blanche Jacobs , Kitti Gilborn's death had a quite different effect ."
"For Blanche , Kitti's death was a source of guilty , but nonetheless soaring , happy hope ."
"In Blanche's defense , it must be said she was unaware of the newborn hope ."
"If anyone had asked her , she would have described herself only as nervous and worried ."
"She wanted to be with him , to give him the comfort and companionship she knew he needed ."
She had skipped her lunch hour in the fear that he might call while she was out .
"And now she was feeling sick , both from concern about Stanley and hunger ."
"Men , she reflected , even men like Stanley , are unpredictable ."
"Without warning , without giving her a chance to prepare for it ."
"When he left , she knew she would never see him again ."
"She could always predict what Stanley was going to do , ever since she first met him ."
"The morning he walked in to announce to her , blushing , that he was married ."
She had assumed before then that one day he would ask her to marry him .
She thought it was sometime during the second week she worked for Stanley .
"For Blanche , it was only a matter of time before Stanley would propose ."
"It was to be expected that Stanley would be shy , slow in taking such a momentous step ."
"Indeed , there was a woman who , unasked , had already given him love ."
It might have been easier for her if Kitti Walker hadn't been everything that Blanche was not .
"Stanley had gone out , saying he would be back in an hour ."
"After that day , Blanche still didn't know exactly what had happened ."
"Somehow , Blanche managed to cover the stunned surprise and offer her congratulations ."
That night the two of them left for a week's honeymoon in Acapulco .
"For exactly one week , she was able to continue in this manner ."
"On the morning of Stanley's return , however , her strength left her ."
"She didn't tell anyone , even her mother , what was wrong ."
"She refused to have a doctor , insisting there was nothing a doctor could do for her ."
"He demonstrated by playing an imaginary piano , doing a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerated attack ."
"If Rose Mallory's killer acted this way , catching up with him was going to be a cinch ."
We'd know him by his stretch pants and the flowers he'd wear twined in his hair .
"That , incidentally , might give you some idea of what Felix was like ."
"After all , he hadn't happened upon us in that second-floor hall without warning ."
The M.E.'s boys had finished their on-the-spot examination and the body had been removed for autopsy .
"Instead of answering you , he sticks his head in the door and shouts up the stairs ."
What I'm getting at is that we were fully prepared for Felix's being an odd one .
His hair had receded most of the way to the back of his neck .
He had only a fringe of hair and he wore it cropped short .
He wasn't a dwarf but he was a bit of a comic figure .
For Felix it was a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement .
He was dressed in a manner Esquire might suggest for the outdoor man's country weekend .
"Dark gray sports jacket , lighter gray slacks , pink flannel shirt , black silk necktie ."
"`` You always live up to your name , always like this , always making happy '' ? ?"
`` The world is full of blokes who put their hearts into making the tragic scene .
Is there any other time in which a man can live '' ? ?
"He was prancing along the hall , heading for the next flight of stairs ."
"`` We're here because of what happened last night '' , he said ."
"Since it is important , for the record let's have the full name '' ."
`` I can't see what would make it necessary for you to know .
Nothing could make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world '' .
"If you can possibly avoid it , you don't hand out any extra chances ."
"Expecting something more-than-average wacky , I was surprised by what we found ."
There was no display of either works in progress or of finished work .
"These shapes might have been mad , but there was no telling ."
"Everything was orderly and it seemed to be arranged for the workman's comfort , convenience and efficiency ."
Memory flooded him the instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling knotted his stomach .
"Presumably the same sun was shining upon little Drew also , and those who had kidnapped him ."
"It was still a very big world , despite all the modern cant to the contrary ."
The only reason for contacting Lissa was to comfort or to be comforted .
"What remained lacked the original verve but it was at least dignified , as befitting the tragic circumstances ."
Raymond Fox reported that the orchestra had hastily rehearsed `` Cradle Song '' in case it was needed .
"Long before he reached the protection of the stage door , Andy was recognized ."
It was not a hostile gathering but Andy sensed the difference from last night's hero-worshippers .
"Under the heading of it's an ill wind , et cetera '' ."
He instructed Shirl Winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted on the call board .
It's just barely possible with this crowd that the kidnapper wasn't able to get a table .
"Skolman isn't going to like it much , though , giving away what he should be selling '' ."
"A short time later , Lieutenant Bonner stomped into the dressing room ."
"`` I got a bone to pick with you , Mr. Paxton ."
"My men have been here all afternoon , setting up for this thing '' ."
"Bonner explained that , with the nightclub's cooperation , the police had occupied El Dorado like a battlefield ."
"`` Seems like we're never going to see eye to eye , Lieutenant ."
Didn't they tell you what I wanted the p. a. system for '' ? ?
You think somebody is going to stand up in the audience and make guilty faces ? ?
"Or have a sign on his car that says , ' Here Comes the Paxton Kidnapper ' '' ? ?"
`` I can't stop you from doing what you think is right .
"`` Someday '' , Bonner said , `` you're going to ask us for help ."
`` What you don't understand is that I'm asking for it now '' .
He had gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination ; ;
"The crime showed too much planning , the kidnappers appeared too proficient to be caught by a checklist ."
"He stalled for a half-hour longer , hoping to hear something from Vecchio about the ransom money ."
"When no one smiled , he felt constrained to add , `` Just kidding , natch '' ."
"Thornburg popped in to advise , `` Andy , Skolman's sending up smoke signals ."
"Andy said , `` Well , I guess we can't wait any longer ."
If Rock shows up during the number -- or you hear anything -- give me the signal '' .
"Shirl Winter said , `` I'll stay on the phone , Mr. Paxton ."
"Andy passed into the corridor , their `` good lucks '' ! !"
"The result had nothing of the polish , pace or cohesion of the previous night ."
Whether he sang well or badly had nothing to do with it .
Eliminating the patter and the upbeat numbers left little but blues and other songs of equal melancholy .
"The effect was as depressing as a gravestone , the applause irresolute and short-lived ."
"the evening was still not beyond salvaging , not as a show but for him as a person ."
"As Andy reached the finale of his act , a subdued commotion backstage drew his attention to the wings ."
"Ray , if you please -- the ' Cradle Song ' '' ."
He sensed rather than heard the gasp that swept across the audience .
"Having no choice , he plunged into it , anyway , holding onto the microphone for support ."
"But when he was finally through , their scorn was made apparent ."
"At this moment , all he could think of was what he'd been forced to undergo ."
"Thornburg knew , better than any of them , that a public image was as fragile as Humpty Dumpty ."
He clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing room .
Old man Arthur had put down the suitcase to open the front door .
under the scraggly brows the pale old eyes burned with a bitter memory .
"Rossi and Ferguson have been across the street , talking to the kid ."
"He limps , and the man who hit you and took the cane , he limped ."
"You should have gone to work today , 'stead of sneaking around spying on the Dronk house '' ."
"`` The trouble with you '' , old man Arthur began , and then checked himself ."
Young Mrs. Arthur had opened the oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuits .
The old man opened the door and stepped out into the sunlight .
"`` They found something else up there '' , she said half-aloud to the empty room ."
"She walked restlessly across the room , then back to the windows ."
"`` Now they've gone , they didn't come back , and they didn't arrest that Dronk boy '' ."
"She smoothed the skirt , sat down , then stood up and went back to the windows ."
`` Why on earth did I send him off to work ? ?
There was excuse enough to keep him home that young Mr. Arthur's still over there '' .
"With sudden energy , she went to the phone and rang Holden's office and asked for him ."
"Mr. Crosson's been on everybody's neck , an order he expected didn't come through and he's '' --"
I'm all alone and certain things are going on that look very ominous .
I need someone to go out and find out what's happening '' .
"`` But I couldn't do that , even if I were home '' ! !"
`` I can't be underfoot every time those cops turn around ! !
I'd think that you even more than I would be wondering what they're up to .
he went to the window and choked there with the fresh breeze on his face .
"Once out in the street , the traffic was a gadfly maze in which he wandered stricken ."
"He tried to ignore what his own common sense told him , but it wasn't possible ; ;"
"Well , it hadn't been what it seemed , he'd had no idea the girl was in there ."
There was no use wandering off into a territory of utter nightmare .
"He drove , and the road wobbled , familiar scenes crept past on either side ."
He had the feeling that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere to hide .
"There was really no place to go , finally , except home to Mae ."
"Cooper was beside his car , on the curb at the right , just standing there morosely ; ;"
Behind him on the steps of the little office sat old man Arthur ; ;
"he was straight , something angry in his attitude , as if he might be waiting to report something ."
"He drove into the paved space before the garage and got out , slamming the car door ."
"If Ferguson's car had been in sight , Holden would have walked directly to it ."
He went to the front door and opened it and looked in .
"`` I've been thinking '' , she said , swallowing the toast ."
`` Didn't you have an old pair of painting overalls in the garage ? ?
You used them that time you painted the porch at our other house .
I'm sure they were in the garage up until a couple of days ago .
"You used to paint in them , and then you just took them for rags ."
You're going to have to go to the police and explain what happened .
"`` Begin to look like him now , would you say ? ?"
"And men also used vacuum cleaners in both rooms , sucking dust up once more ."
"Men from the Third Detective District , Eighteenth Precinct , had the longest , the most tedious , job ."
( `` I certainly was not at the Dumont last night and my husband couldn't have been .
The Hotel King Arthur across the street provided almost twice as many problems .
"The King Arthur had fifty-four overnighters , again counting rooms rather than people ."
"( Anyone active enough can reach a roof , wherever his room may be ."
It was not even certain the shot had been fired from either hotel .
"Like , for example , a man carrying a twenty-two rifle , probably with a telescopic sight attached ? ?"
"There was , of course , no hope it really would be that simple ."
"( Detective Pearson , Eighteenth Precinct , thought for a time he might be on to something ."
"Well , a man had tried , at the King Arthur , to register with an ocelot ."
"At the Dumont , a guest had come in a collapsible wheel chair ."
"As reports dribbled in , William Weigand tossed them into the centrifuge which had become his head ."
"There was no sign of Mrs. Lauren Payne at her house on Nod Road , Ridgefield , Connecticut ."
"They had been with Payne when he was shot , could not therefore have shot him from above ."
He would have had ample time to go into a blind somewhere and wait his prey .
"But -- hunch , now -- Willings would not ambush anything which went on two legs instead of four ."
"Ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves , as any man may against a tiger ."
"Faith Constable had had to `` go on '' from the party and had , presumably , gone on ."
"Also , he thought , I doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun ."
"She might , conceivably , have brought one in in a large-enough suitcase ."
"But -- it happened , almost always , among the primitive and , usually , among the very young ."
"It occurred to Bill Weigand that he was , on a hunch basis , eliminating a good many ."
He also reminded himself that he had an unusual number of possibilities .
"The Masons , mother or son , or mother and son ? ?"
"Here , too , the cause to hate lay well back in the years ."
"But bitterness had more cause to remain , even increasingly to corrode ."
Seeing the man he blamed for this made much of -- youth and bitterness and --
"A man named Lars Simon , playwright-director , had expressed a wish that Anthony Payne drop dead ."
"He would say , of course , that he had not really had any such wish ; ;"
"would certainly deny any connection between the two things , or any connection of either with murder ."
"Bill Weigand was good and tired of the wall opposite , and the crack in the plaster ."
When Siamese cats are intertwined it is difficult to tell where one leaves off and another begins .
"On the other hand , they , or it , seemed to have no legs whatever ."
"But at this the one too-large cat suddenly became two cats , stretching ."
"Shadow , the more talkative , began at once to talk , her voice piteous ."
"Stilts , a more direct cat , leaped from the bed and trotted briskly toward the kitchen ."
"After a time , it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth the trouble ."
"Had Faith Constable's explanation of her confidence , so uninvited , been a little thin ? ?"
"That was more like a thought , but not a great deal more ."
"Pam realized , to her surprise , that she had been almost dozing ."
"Even with words coming too fast , they came on the music of the voice ."
"`` Call this a cry for help '' , Faith Constable said ."
And it makes a very poor red herring for an inside job .
"At last he said , `` Well , thank you for calling , Mr. Benson ."
`` He's just heard from the pathologist who says Mrs. Meeker apparently died from suffocation '' .
Scrapings from the bed linen identical with the lint and thread found in the nasal and oral cavities .
"No signs of these , no gross hemorrhage of lungs , heart , brain or stomach '' ."
"Probably around midnight , give or take an hour either way '' ."
"`` Not your problem , of course , unless Johnston and the murderer are one and the same '' ."
"However likely it was , Pauling said , he couldn't limit himself to it ."
He might have been in collusion with Johnston on the fraud ; ;
he might be Mrs. Meeker's murderer or have played some part in her death .
"If Arthur Williams was involved in the fraud or the murder , then he too had another identity ."
No one the Medfield police had questioned professed to know any more about him than about Johnston .
Madden explained that he was thinking of an application sent directly to Mrs. Meeker .
"Mr. Hohlbein was out for the day , but Mr. Garth would be free at one-thirty ."
Promptly at one-thirty he entered Hohlbein and Garth's elegant suite of offices in Medfield's newest professional building .
that Mrs. Garth would be impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer ; ;
"that there were three children , two boys and a girl ; ;"
"that she was active in the Woman's Club and he in Lions , Rotary , and Jaycee ; ;"
"and finally , that neither of them had harbored an unorthodox opinion since their wedding day ."
Madden regretted not being able to find fault with so true a statement .
`` Was she in the habit of making new wills '' ? ?
She had reason to change the one she made right after Mr. Meeker's death .
She wanted to make a more equitable distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the most ; ;
"`` Mr. Hohlbein and I have noticed some lapses since , though ."
Even two or three years ago I doubt that she'd have become involved in this unfortunate Johnston affair .
"She always did before , and showed the utmost confidence in whatever we advised '' ."
"Mrs. Meeker hadn't struck him as ready to seek anyone's advice , least of all Garth's ."
"He went on to personal bequests , a list of names largely unknown to him ."
( No additional five thousand for each year after Joan's twenty-first birthday ; ;
"Madden took up this point with Garth , who shrugged it off ."
`` This one came a bit high at thirty thousand or more .
"`` Well , she had a number of them where money was concerned '' , Garth said ."
No doubt Mrs. Meeker had snubbed him many a time and he felt no grief over her passing .
"Even so , Madden's dislike of the suave , correct lawyer deepened ."
"At first glance , not much of a motive for a man of his standing ; ;"
"but for all his air of affluence , who could tell what his private financial picture was ? ?"
"Nevertheless , he made a mental note to look into Garth's financial background ."
"He occupied a two-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor , using the second bedroom as his office ."
"Airy and bright , the apartment was furnished with good modern furniture , rugs , and draperies ."
"Done by a professional decorator , Madden thought , and somehow as impersonal , as unremarkable as its occupant ."
In Dunston the rent would run close to two hundred a month ; ;
"It contained a desk , files , a typewriter on a stand , and two big leather armchairs ."
"For all her domineering ways , I can't conceive of her having had a deadly enemy '' ."
"`` Dammit , Phil , are you trying to wreck my career ? ?"
"Because that's what you're doing -- wrecking it , wrecking it , wrecking it '' ! !"
"A couple of sobs escaped him , followed by a sentiment that revealed his emotional state ."
"`` Why , I'm not fit to touch the hem of her garment '' ."
Griffith was trying to clear his head of the champagne fuzz that encased it .
He turned and fled into the house and made his way up the marble stairs without once looking back .
"The way Hoag was , no telling what he might say or do ."
He spotted Docherty coming out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called to him .
"Docherty said , `` It's okay , Bonfiglio , let him by '' ."
"Griffith said , `` Hoag told me to tell you '' -- he waited until they were close ; ;"
`` He claims Mahzeer's in a plot to kill the P.M. '' .
he wasn't going to allow himself to be led meekly to the slaughter .
One more muddleheaded play like that one and they'd be leading him away .
But Hoag had not stayed on the front steps when Griffith disappeared into the building .
The door opened and three men and a woman in a sari swept past him and down the stairs .
In the lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their wraps .
Hoag descended the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building .
Wide windows with many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories .
On the second floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests ; ;
On the third floor one of the two windows was lighted ; ;
"it was framed in maroon drapes , and no faces were visible ."
they would be going over papers Mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting .
"In a minute , or five minutes , the business would be done ; ;"
Narrow four-story buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf .
Muller's would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly opposite .
if the angle of fire were too great the jutting buildings on either side would interfere .
But dully glinting on the dark form were the buttons and badge of a policeman .
"Hoag crossed the narrow street , squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk ."
"From this side he could see farther into the legation's third-story window , but he saw no faces ; ;"
the room's occupants were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain .
He walked rapidly along the buildings scanning their facades : one was a club -- that was out ; ;
"That left three , possibly four , one looking much like the next ."
He climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule .
that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance .
On one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes ; ;
This was senseless -- he had no idea what to look for .
"all were empty except one , and that one was jammed with letters and magazines ."
Now he was certain : the lock had not yielded to Muller's collection of keys ; ;
"It had been shut again , but the lock was broken ; ;"
he noted with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch .
He would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop .
His thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door .
he stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill .
Hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled for the switch : evil flourishes in the dark .
The room was bathed in light at the instant Muller's second shot came .
A shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain ; ;
"Hoag stumbled back into the hall , leaned against the wall , and started to retch ."
"It was more a matter of tact , and also it was none of Killpath's goddam business ."
He stared at the clerk who sat at a scarred and ancient fumed-oak desk stuffing envelopes .
Gun waited for Killpath to sit down behind the desk near the window .
It was the posture which the men had come to recognize as that of Killpath defying his ulcer .
"He rocked back in the chair , knee locked against stomach , his beady eyes fixed on Matson ."
"He was silent again , possibly listening to the sounds in the squadroom ."
"Killpath said , `` You were expected to report to my office twenty minutes ago , Sergeant ."
"That's not getting all the juice out of the orange , now is it '' ? ?"
"`` I called the station at three this morning '' , Killpath's nasal voice pronounced ."
`` Do you have any idea who might have been in charge at the time '' ? ?
`` What if I said nobody was here but a couple of patrolmen '' ? ?
"`` Sir , Vaughn knows better than to leave the station without a relief ."
`` He let a patrolman take over the duties of the station keeper .
"`` But you didn't know a thing about it , did you '' ? ?"
"his foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again , frowning now ."
"`` That's not taking one's command with a responsible attitude , Matson '' ."
He stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk .
"He took up a white sheet of paper , dark with single-spaced data ."
But for some fool reason he couldn't remember which men he'd put on the transfer detail .
"Killpath sailed the paper across the desk , but Matson didn't pick it up or even glance at it ."
"`` I didn't think Accacia knew so many big words , Lieutenant '' ."
"`` Let's not push our patience beyond the danger line , Sergeant '' , Killpath nasaled ."
`` I shouldn't like to have to write you up for insubordination as well as dereliction of duty '' .
"Killpath leaned forward again , rocked comfortably with his arms still wrapped around one knee ."
"`` Let's just remember , Sergeant , that we must all carry our own umbrella ."
"He could pick up another pack on his way home , if he were going home ."
"Casey made some comment , but his mind was busy as he considered the man ."
"His name was George Needham and he , too , had come from a good family ."
"He was perhaps thirty-two , nicely set up , with light brown hair that had a pronounced wave ."
"Since then he had worked at this and that , though some said his main interest was gambling ."
For he had understood that Betty had been engaged to a boy named Barry Jenkins .
"He wanted to ask her about Jenkins now , but he knew he couldn't do so in Needham's presence ."
The girl's eyes were softly shining as she reached out and touched Casey's hand .
"None of this showed in his face , and he tried to keep his skepticism in hand ."
"He made a point of frowning , of acting out the part of the fond father-confessor ."
"`` I'll have to give it some thought '' , he said ."
"If you're really serious about working on that story , I'd better take you home '' ."
"Casey watched them go , still frowning absently and then dismissing the matter as he called for his check ."
For another second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was directed at himself ; ;
The important thing was that Burton had gone somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun in his pocket .
"He put the shells on the table , as though he could no longer bear to hold them ."
He tried to tell himself that maybe Burton had sobered up enough to get some sense .
When he heard Calenda say : `` What about that picture you took this afternoon '' ? ?
It still took him another few seconds to remember the job he had done for Frank Ackerly .
Calenda was not the sort who walked around without one of his `` boys '' close at hand .
`` With my trial coming up in Federal Court next week I wouldn't want that picture published '' .
"Even so , he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections properly ."
His nerves were getting a little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice .
That's all I know about it and that's all I care '' .
`` Maybe you'd better tell the guy who hired you what I said '' .
"`` All right '' , Calenda said , his voice still quiet ."
"`` Just be sure to send your two best boys , Tony '' ."
He dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung up .
He called the bar and grill where he had picked Burton up that afternoon .
Each time he got the same answer and in the end he gave up .
By the time he had smoked three cigarettes he had calmed down .
He kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make a drink .
He considered opening a can of beer but vetoed that idea too .
Finally he went into the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes .
He had just finished unlacing the right one when the telephone rang again .
When he snatched it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent .
If you want a picture get to the corner of Adams and Clark just as fast as you can .
Some telephoned because he had done them a favor in the past .
"The police car had pulled up behind a small sedan , its headlights still on ."
"Poet came in , raising his eyebrows appreciatively as he saw Elaine ."
"`` Reverse '' , Elaine said , then peered through the loop of the RDF and waved to Poet ."
"Nick watched her somewhat enviously as she efficiently cut the engines , and started the auxiliary motor ."
"Nick wondered if Elaine had bought them , but he said nothing ."
"But instead of chatter there was a null , like on the radio direction finder ."
"They had all been laughing , joking , when suddenly the engine had failed ."
"All had fallen into a complete silence , listening to the wind whistle over the wings ."
There had been tension in the plane during the silent descent ; ;
"It hung over them like a cloud , its arrival as sudden as a cloud skidding over the sun ."
"`` And the deadliest '' , Poet commented as he buckled on his tank harness ."
Poet nodded to Nick and entered the water in a similar fashion .
"For a while Nick followed the twisting course of the bubbles , wondering which set came from Elaine ."
"They remained close together , their air trail wiggling like serpents traveling side by side ."
"Clasping his hands behind his head , he stared at the blue sky ."
There was nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean .
"Next to the ocean , probably the loneliest spot was the desert ."
"If Elaine's uncle had stuck to this desire for aloneness , he probably would still be alive ."
And Graham wanted money probably to roam among the dice tables in Las Vegas .
It was an odd combination a strange pair to stumble upon the wreck of the Trinidad .
The small helicopter with its two steel skids churned offshore and Nick raised up to watch it heading south .
If the character flying that thing had gone over San Clemente Island yesterday he would have had an eyeful .
"Behind it a cabin cruiser drifted crossways in the small ground-swell , a lone fisherman in the chair aft ."
Sometimes the fish exploded as they neared the surface because of the difference in pressure .
"Why , he wondered , had Elaine wanted him along on this trip ? ?"
"He couldn't skindive , he couldn't run a boat , except on the open sea ."
"He stood up , stretched , looked around for the bubbles , but could see none ."
"Elaine and Poet returned together , popping up over the transom almost like dolphins breaking water ."
He sat up and watched as they pulled themselves over the stern .
"Poet shook his head , sliding his face mask up on his forehead ."
"`` We're right on the edge of the Deep '' , Elaine said ."
"He tossed her a towel , then repeated the service for Poet ."
"Elaine shook her head as she slipped out of her harness , but Poet nodded ."
"The fin on his foot caught on the moulding , throwing him off balance ."
The word hissed distinctly from Poet's lips as he struggled to his feet .
His face was still creased in pain as he studied the underside of his arm .
"Turning quickly toward Elaine , Nick saw that she , too , stood in shocked surprise ."
"Instinctively aware of the charged atmosphere , Poet raised his head slowly , looking first at Elaine ."
"Her face was frozen into the mask of a mannequin , her body absolutely motionless ."
"And then Nick knew that all of them knew Elaine , himself and Poet ."
"Elaine recovered first , so quickly that Nick thought he might have imagined her sudden reaction ."
"But her walk was too steady , too slow , telegraphing her fear ."
"At the same instant , Nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man ."
"Poet was the captured , arms pinioned to his side , and he twisted convulsively trying to escape ."
"The rubber and glass face mask slipped from Poet's forehead , bounced painlessly off Nick's chin , then disappeared ."
"Poet twisted again and Nick's knuckles scraped on the air tank , ripping off the skin ."
Something flailed at the side of Nick's head as they rolled around and around .
"A black , snake-like object swayed eerily in front of him , spewing bubbles from its flat cobra head ."
"Desperately , Nick flashed one hand up , catching Poet's neck in the bend of his elbow ."
Instinctively he exhaled through his nose then sucked in the air from the hose .
"At once the excruciating pain in his chest stopped and he was seized with a sudden , wild exultation ."
"Relentlessly , Nick held on , sucking on the hose , inhaling the air that belonged to Poet ."
Harbor Point sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck of a steamer clam .
"Seeing me he said with real surprise , `` Well , well , ain't we honored ! !"
His sarcasm was followed by a stupid grin of his thick mouth and bad teeth .
"`` I guess it helps '' , I said , paying no attention to his ribbing ."
"`` Never could figure out why you ever wanted to be a cop , Jed ."
"You're not only young but well , you don't even look like a police officer ."
"In my day the first requirement for a cop was to look like the law , big and tough ."
"Came to the Harbor as a bride and Don't worry Jed , this one is in the bag ."
"I know the killer , have the only road off the peninsula covered '' ."
"Although Bob dressed like a slob , he kept a neat office ."
Colored fellow named Tim Williams -- only hand she has working for her now .
"Julia Buck , the deceased '' , Moore said , slipping me his smug , idiot-grin again ."
"But she didn't sound real alarmed you know , like there was any immediate danger ."
No doubt about Tim being the killer -- I have a witness .
"`` Yeah , seems you have a nice package , with all the strings tied ."
`` Julia had -- has -- an old Indian woman cooking for her -- Nellie Harris .
Nellie went on with her house work -- until I found Julia dead .
"And before you say it , Nellie ain't near strong enough to have strangled Julia ."
But there's no way off the Point except through my road block .
Guess you want to see the body -- have her up the street in Doc Abel's office '' .
"We walked up Main Street to this big white house , then around to the back ."
"Being the Harbor's sole doctor , Abel was also its Medical Examiner ."
Doc Abel was busy up front with some of his live patients .
"Pulling back the sheet , I examined the bruises around Julia Buck's once slender throat ."
"Chief Moore shook his big head , seemed lost in thought as he stared at the nude body ."
"I told him , `` I want to go see the Buck house '' ."
"As I slid in beside him he said , `` Some heap , hey ? ?"
"Got a heck of a buy on this , dirt cheap '' ."
"Everything shouted gentleman farming , the kind of grandfather-father-to-son folding money the Point is known for ."
"The old gal stared at me with her hard eyes , said , `` She didn't call ."
`` Have you any idea what this Tim and Mrs. Buck were arguing about '' ? ?
"The wrinkled mouth laughed , revealing astonishingly strong , white , teeth ."
`` Was she on friendly terms with other members of her family '' ? ?
"I told Moore , `` Where does Tim's wife live '' ? ?"
In late summer migratory workers lived five and six to a room in these .
"Now they were empty , except for a cottage across the road ."
"`` Well , for this week , but they wasn't due 'till Saturday ."
"Listen , Mr. Inspector , no matter what anybody say , my Tim didn't kill that woman ! !"
He never in his life took a hand to a woman or ''
"`` We'll get him soon , see what he says '' , Chief Moore cut in ."
"I asked a silly question : `` You've no idea where your husband could be , now '' ? ?"
"I stood there , staring at her for a moment -- thinking mostly of her beauty and her poverty ."
"Moore said , `` Come on , Jed , I have to get to my men '' ."
"Hiding out like this won't get him anything , except more trouble , or a bullet '' ."
We made it back to the Harbor in less than four minutes .
"I told Moore I was going to eat , get some forms filled out by Doc Abel ."
"It wasn't a new boat , about five years old , but fitted with fishing outriggers and chairs ."
I asked an old guy running a fishing station if the boat was Moore's .
"For another moment we didn't talk , then she began to weep ."
"She mumbled , `` I just know that Chief Moore is out to kill my Tim '' ! !"
"`` Of course , it could be because this is his first murder case ."
"You know where Tim is , don't you , Mrs. Williams '' ? ?"
"She puffed on the cigarette slowly , sitting slumped against the back seat ; ;"
Take the same train Diana Beauclerk took and get there at the same time .
`` Will the hotel rent it so soon after the crime '' ? ?
"Besides , the number of the suite hasn't been published in any newspaper ."
`` The police will have gone over every square inch of the place with a fine-tooth comb .
"`` There's always a chance they may have overlooked something '' , returned the chief ."
`` Suppose the murderer should return to the scene of the crime '' ! !
"So did the firm of lawyers who had got her the divorce , Kimball and Stacy ."
She reached Pearson City at nine p.m. and went straight to the Hotel Westmore .
"She was in good health and spirits , but still determined to get the money from Forbes ."
Next morning she was found dead in her suite with a bullet from a
"According to the medical examiner , she was shot between eleven p.m. and one a.m. ."
When Alec finished reading he was sure that either Forbes or Stacy had killed Diana Beauclerk .
Find a motive for Stacy or an opportunity for Forbes and the case would be solved .
"The Hotel Westmore proved to be one of the older hotels in Pearson City , and definitely second-rate ."
Alec's glance went to a chart of guest names and room numbers hanging on the wall behind the clerk .
"Two women , who had been chattering like parrots , were struck dumb ."
"A man , lighting a match for his cigar , paused until the flame burned his fingers ."
"Alec leaned on the desk , holding the clerk's eyes with his ."
"`` Suppose you tell me the real reason '' , he drawled ."
Either I get the story -- or I get the suite '' .
The stillness persisted as Alec followed a bellboy across the lobby to the elevator .
He wished it had not been necessary to announce the number of his suite quite so publicly .
The corridor on the eleventh floor was dimly lighted by electric globes at intervals of thirty feet .
At the end of the corridor Alec noticed a door marked : Fire Stairs .
The room was dark but a neon sign flashed and faded beyond the window .
"A few snowflakes sifted down through that theatrical red glow , languid as falling feathers ."
"Table covers and towels were clean , ashtrays empty and supplied with fresh matches ."
"The mirror over the bureau was a blank eye , round and innocent ."
`` Afraid you'll lose your job if you don't keep your mouth shut '' ? ?
"If you want my advice , pack up and take the next train back to New York '' ."
But I wouldn't spend a night in here for a million bucks '' ! !
Alec locked the hall door and put the key with his watch on the bedside table .
"Not gray like the dust that collects in an unused room , but white ."
Blood in the bathtub where the murderer appears to have washed his hands .
In the darkness he could see the rosy reflection of the neon sign on the wall opposite the window .
"It winked as steadily as a metronome -- on , off -- on , off ."
"He lay still , listening to the silence , watching the light ."
Somewhere in the city a big clock sounded twelve solemn notes -- midnight .
According to the medical examiner she was shot between eleven p.m. and one a.m. .
His heart seemed to swell and knock against the wall of his chest .
"A monstrous shadow fell across the illuminated wall , distorted and indefinable ."
"When the neon sign flashed on , the shadow was still there ."
"It stretched to an impossible height , climbing the wall to the ceiling ."
Someone had moved beyond the range of the light from the window .
"Abandoning caution , Alec leaped out of bed and groped for the light switch ."
"Before he could snap it on , a stinging blow caught him in the ribs ."
He put everything he had into the next and aimed down where the stomach ought to be .
"There was a grunt , curiously inarticulate , like that of an animal in pain ."
The blue rug had been rolled up and stacked in one corner of the room .
There was a slight bulge under the left armpit -- a shoulder holster .
A professional gunman would not have killed her with a weapon of such small caliber as a
"Alec expected an indignant denial , but there was no response at all ."
"Only that curious , animal grunting Alec had heard during their fight ."
There were hideous scars inside the throat and the palate was mutilated .
"`` Sister '' , said he `` do you think people who commit suicide go to heaven '' ? ?"
"And she answered , `` I don't know , but I hope you'll never do such a thing '' ."
"He said , and went out and cut his throat in the cave near Granny Day's swamp ."
"and I knew they knew it , for I'd told them a lot of it ."
"Yes , gentlemen , I am getting to the point , to my point ."
And my point in this sad story is the spirit of the matter .
"And the truth is what you've come for , is it not ? ?"
There were no witch burnings here because everyone had a witch in the family .
After that he was never known to run or even walk fast .
Today Dogtown is the only deserted village in all New England that I know of .
"There it sits , a small highland , with towns like Gloucester near by ; ;"
but now it's the most lost and tortured place in the world .
Those who lived in that desolation of rocky deformity took on some of the moraine's stony character .
"( I myself have identified about sixty sites , from the old maps and registers ."
"Both Red McIver and Handley Walker lived nearby , almost as near as I do ."
I'd often find one or other of them up around Dogtown sketching .
"Handley married Freya and Red , of the red beard , married Anta ."
And it was because of an old Norberg inheritance that I got to understand them all so well .
"The quarrel ended in a ridiculous draw , but I must tell you about it ."
"Oh , yes , I'm quite sure it's important , because of the Beech Pasture ."
"You see , besides being custodian of antiquities , I am also registrar ."
"No , I don't hold with those who live entirely among dead things ."
"As I was saying , I've known all about the old records , including the old Norberg deed ."
"Some ten years ago that page was torn out , I don't know by whom ."
"About five years ago , Handley came to ask me if he could see the tattered register ."
"He was courteous and casual about it , as though it were of no consequence ."
"He's always like that , in spite of being a big man ."
") A sensual man , but very courteous , some would say slick ."
"The next week , cousin Red wandered in as casually , but curt and untidy ."
"When I told him someone had torn it out , he shouted ."
And later in the same week they both came together to examine the register .
"Red thrusting out his tawny beard , Handley glowering under his suddenly rumpled black hair ."
"Red always was morose , yet that day the dapper Handley was the louder of the two ."
"But for my presence , they would have been at each others' throats ."
"During the quarrel I learned what the trouble was , from the accusations each hurled at the other ."
"There's a fine granite quarry there , and granite's coming back for public buildings ."
"That battle scene , ridiculous as it was , remained in my mind ."
"Gloomy and unkempt as Red McIver was , he was much the better painter ."
"If Red had a show at Gloucester , Handley would hurry to hang his pictures in Rockport ."
"I would call them the patterns of life , perhaps even the designs of destiny ."
I suppose these absences gave her more clearance for her embraces with Cousin Handley .
"No , he didn't have his gun , which he should have ."
It would have been a good excuse for his being there at all .
"Haney peered doubtfully at his drinking companion through bleary , tear-filled eyes ."
"He had no ready answer , as much from surprise as from the fit of coughing ."
"The guy is off his rocker , Haney thought to himself , and looked away from those eyes ."
"As a matter of fact , he wouldn't have cared at all if the guy had been hit ."
"Then the man he saved turned and looked squarely into the truck driver's face , without saying a word ."
It must have been the sort of look that can call a bluff without saying a word .
"When the light went their way , they went on across the street ."
"Now he wondered if it was worth it , having a screwball for company ."
"He really didn't take the offer seriously , but he began to feel uneasy ."
I might have got hit by that truck if it wasn't for you .
Maybe it would be better to humor the guy and then make an exit .
"He really didn't expect anything to come of it , and there were a few people"
He keeps riding me because I like to listen to the radio and sing while I'm taking a bath .
Why don't they tell me themselves if it bothers them '' ? ?
"Five minutes later , before Haney could make his break , the stranger stood up and nodded farewell ."
"The next day , Sunday , the hangover reminded Haney where he had been the night before ."
"The hangover in turn reminded him of his conversation with the weirdy , and he groaned ."
His spine crawled with a foreboding premonition as he asked one of his fellow tenants what had happened .
"Haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden pallor , as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks ."
"He muttered something about how terrible it was , and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator ."
"Once inside his apartment , he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped limply in a chair ."
"Still later , he finally convinced himself that it was an accident -- just a coincidence ."
"Haney went to bed , happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord ."
"Really , he said to himself , nobody kills a man just as a favor ! !"
"The stranger's eyes were large and sad , as if Phil Haney had hurt his feelings ."
"He might be very tight , but he knew where he was ."
He was enjoying the weekly ritual of washing down his pet grievance with bourbon slightly moistened with water .
"In fact , he had only mentioned him on the spur of the moment ."
"The man was uncanny , like a shadow , and made as much noise as a shadow ."
He began to wish that he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through the crossing .
Was he going to be saddled from now on with a creep for a bar-buddy ? ?
He'd have to start going to some of the other places again .
"The guy sulked over his drink , obviously upset by Haney's lack of appreciation ."
"When he paused to moisten his throat , the stranger broke in ."
I'd have to sell out my business to pay her off with her share .
"You must understand , I haven't been in this state too long ."
That's why I -- why I do a free job now and then .
Haney felt a twinge of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again .
Suppose -- just suppose this guy was really what he said he was ! !
"A retired professional killer If he was just a nut , no harm was done ."
"But if he was the real thing , he could do something about Lolly ."
"He felt very cunning , very proud of himself as he played on the other man's soft spot ."
"The cops didn't suspect a thing , and I thought it was a coincidence ."
`` But if you say you managed it '' The stranger was hooked .
I always work it that way -- and always at a time when the customer has an alibi .
"`` floor level's about three feet down , so don't fall '' ."
I jist stayed where I was while he fumbled around and then walked away .
"A moment later he struck a match and lighted a candle , and I could see ."
I looked back over my shoulder while I went to join him ; ;
he'd hung another half of a blanket over the boarded window so no light would show through .
"`` Listen , I got a buddy I travel with , real nice guy named Larry ."
We'll both be blowing town tomorrow so we won't be moving in on you '' .
"`` He'll bring a bottle too , and I'll get another one or maybe two while I'm out ."
"You can work on this one while I'm gone , kill it if you want '' ."
I took a short swallow from it myself and handed it to him .
"`` Git over by the window while there's light , an' I'll put th' candle out ."
When yuh come back I'll put it out agin till you're both inside '' .
`` But we got to go back to Fifth and get another bottle or two .
I introduced my friend Larry to Pops and we made ourselves comfortable .
"I said , `` Wait wait '' to Charlie and he grinned , digging the reference ."
"Pops was taking long ones , but not showing the effect yet ."
"He seemed as drunk as when I'd first talked to him , but no drunker ."
if we'd really been trying to get him dead drunk we'd have had to go out for more wine .
"I said , `` Wait '' , and handed the bottle to Pops for his final drink ."
and he'd never known what hit him -- he'd never known that anything had hit him .
You hit again about twice that hard before we know whether he's dead or not .
That way we'll never know which of us really killed him and which was just the accomplice .
"I took the piece of pipe from Charlie's hand and used it , harder than he had ."
"The thunk was louder , anyway , and I thought I heard bone crack ."
We straightened Pops up and I made sure there was no trace of a heartbeat .
But let's not talk about it abstractly until we're out of here .
"Shall we take them all with us , or leave one '' ? ?"
`` If we left one we'd have to wipe it for fingerprints .
Here's the picture we want to leave for the fuzz -- whenever the body gets found .
This happened in the middle of a drinking bout with another bum .
If they'd been working on a bottle or a jug he'd have taken it with him '' .
"And he'd have taken the weapon with him too , so we take that ."
"They find dead winos every day , maybe they won't even autopsy him for the cause of death '' ."
We've got to assume they'll decide he was murdered and we've got to keep the picture consistent .
Our hypothetical other bum who killed him would have turned out his pockets .
"We did that and found a dirty handkerchief , some matches and fourteen cents in change ."
A fire wouldn't have mattered except that it would cause Pops to be found sooner .
"He might not be found for days , even weeks , otherwise ."
Winsett is a quiet street with no taverns and was completely deserted at that hour .
"Almost too smoothly , I found myself thinking , and then told myself that was ridiculous ."
Also our plans for me to commit Charlie's murder and for him to commit mine .
"We planned ahead only one step , a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could swap notes ."
We made the date for two o'clock in the afternoon at Maxine Wells's pad .
"I was dead tired and slept soundly , as far as I know dreamlessly ."
"I talked first , telling him everything I knew about Seaton and his house and domestic arrangements ."
he memorized them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces and flushed them down .
It didn't take us as long as we'd thought it might ; ;
Shall we flip a coin to see which of us goes first ? ?
"We'll need some at least , if only bus fare to the scene of the crime ."
"I've got a little stashed for a rainy day , and I guess this is rainy enough ."
So it wouldn't be for days or even a week before you could do anything .
"Well -- in that case , I take off tomorrow morning for Frisco ."
"And , in case , I brought the money with me '' ."
Jubal's conversations coming and going -- Jubal's words troubled him most ; ;
In his mind he spoke simultaneously the English sentence and the Martian word and felt closer grokking .
Repeating it like a student telling himself that the jewel is in the lotus he sank into nirvana .
He felt a puppyish need for company as strong as his earlier necessity for quiet .
"He stepped out into the hall , was delighted to encounter a water brother ."
Ben and Stinky went home an hour ago and people started going to bed '' .
"`` I ought to be asleep , too , but I felt like a snack ."
"`` Come on , there's some cold chicken and we'll see what else '' ."
"he was considerate of their weakness , once he learned of it ."
"They picnicked by the pool , then lay back on the grass and looked at stars ."
`` On the side toward the horizon -- the southern hemisphere -- it is spring ; ;
I now grok you are my people -- teach plants another way .
"`` Of the humans we left at the equator , one has discorporated and the others are sad '' ."
Mr. Booker T. W. Jones Food Technician First Class is not sad ; ;
"`` Mike darling '' -- They kissed , and went on kissing ."
"A long time later , by cosmic clock , she said , `` Mike ? ?"
"Is that -- I mean , ' Do you know ' '' --"
On Mars humans were building pressure domes for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship .
Their meditations were approaching a violent cusp that would shape Martian art for many millennia .
Time magazine reviewed it and suggested that the Federation Assembly Daily Record should be translated into the medium .
"Now that Short is Supreme Bishop he'll do all right , he can't help it ."
"Check with one of them , go ahead -- there's no professional jealousy here '' ."
"Oh , you can submit a requisition for a miracle if you want to make a fool of yourself ."
"But , I'm telling you , it'll be turned down -- you don't understand the System yet ."
`` You mean this punk can brush me aside and I've got to hold still for it '' ? ?
"`` I held still for the same thing , didn't I ? ?"
"Now look , there's work to be done and lots of it ."
"If you need a Day off to calm down , duck over to the Muslim Paradise and take it ."
"Otherwise , straighten your halo , square your wings , and dig in ."
The sooner you act like an angel the quicker you'll feel angelic .
Jubal deduced what had happened but did not know with whom -- and didn't want to inquire .
Mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches .
Jubal would not have minded it if service had not gone to pieces .
"However , we sent a third vessel out , a much smaller and faster one than the first two ."
We have learned much about interstellar drives since a hundred years ago ; ;
`` But the third ship came back several years ago and reported ''
"Said Hal , forgetting in his enthusiasm that he had not been asked to speak ."
Macneff stopped pacing to stare at Hal with his pale blue eyes .
"Macneff smiled and said , `` I am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression '' ."
"As I grew older and was promoted , so was he , always where I was ."
He was the dormitory gapt when I went to college and thought I was getting away from him .
He is the one responsible for my getting such low M. R.'s .
"No , not he , for I , and I alone , am responsible for whatever happens to me ."
"So , forgive me , Sigmen , for the contrary-to-reality thoughts ! !"
`` But did the expedition find any records of the Forerunner having been on this planet ? ?
"Perhaps , even , though this is too much to wish , find the Forerunner himself '' ? ?"
`` Though that does not mean that there may not be such records there .
The expedition was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return to Earth .
"If you volunteer , you will be told where you're going after the ship leaves ."
We have considered several of your professionals because they were lamechians and above suspicion .
"And , if a man is married , he will automatically be given a divorce '' ."
"Hal gasped , and he said , `` A divorce '' ? ?"
"Macneff raised his hands apologetically and said , `` You are horrified , of course ."
"Hal , the linguist , saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of the languages spoken therein ."
"If Hal Yarrow had been killed in a crash , he must have wanted it that way ."
"No , the fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch cared ."
He and Mary would no longer have to tear and rend at each other ; ;
"Perhaps , the psychological barriers that had prevented her from conceiving Hal's child would no longer be present ."
"He would no longer have to see that fat face , hear that whining voice"
"And , slowly , feeling himself icy yet burning , Hal turned ."
"There was the squat loose-jowled man , smiling lopsidedly up at him ."
"`` My beloved ward , my perennial gadfly '' , said the whining voice ."
"`` I had no idea that you , too , would be on this glorious voyage ."
"`` Sigmen love you , too , my guardian '' , said Hal , choking ."
I had thought we would never again speak to each other '' .
"Again , a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure would be applied ."
"Then , after slowing the vessel considerably , the drive would adjust to a one-gee deceleration ."
And the crew would be automatically brought out of their suspended animation .
Hal Yarrow was among the last to go into the suspensor and among the first to come out .
"He had to study the recordings of the language of the chief nation of Ozagen , Siddo ."
"And , as Hal found out , obviously mistaken in many cases ."
"For one thing , the organs of speech of the Ozagen natives differed somewhat from Earthmen's ; ;"
"It was true that they could be approximated , but would the Ozagenians understand these approximations ? ?"
The same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses .
No doubt the Angels could do that kind of thing as fast as any computer .
He had already become used to Hesperus' snapping back answers to questions almost before Jack could get them asked .
Of course we have before us the example of the great races at the galactic center ; ;
"But they have survived for long periods as races , whereas you are young ."
We shall recommend to them that they shorten your trial period by half .
"`` For now , it is clear that we were in the wrong ."
"You may reclaim your property , and the penalty on Hesperus is lifted ."
"`` It's a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other '' , Jack said ."
"When it is done between races or nations , it is called making a treaty ."
"`` Hesperus and Lucifer '' , Jack said , `` show that we do '' ."
"But you should understand , Jack , that Hesperus and Lucifer are not long out of the nursery ."
Visiting the Earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older '' .
"`` All the more reason , then '' , Jack said , `` why we must have a treaty ."
"Jack felt a wave of complete elation , but in a second it had vanished without a trace ."
"The history of disarmament agreements , for instance , had been unreassuringly dismal ; ;"
"There was no question in Jack's mind of the good faith on one side , at least ."
It would be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that Earth had ever signed .
"He turned back to the screens , the crucial , conclusive phrase on his lips ."
For a moment he could make no sense at all of what he saw .
"It seemed to be only a riot of color , light and meaningless activity ."
"The Angels in the nursery were zigzagging wildly in all directions , seemingly at random ."
"Jack scanned the skies , the boards , and the skies again ."
"Through the telescope , Jack could see that both spacesuits were still attached to it ."
but even more awesome was the fact that it was trailing an enormous comet's-tail of Angels .
"He would never have believed , without seeing it , that the bizarre little vessel could go so fast ."
"The curve on the card the computer spat back at him couldn't be argued with , however ."
It was clear that Langer had at last found a way to attract the Angel's attention .
"It was equally clear that as of this moment , the treaty was off ."
"Langer would have to be headed off , whether he knew where he was going or not ."
"When he was back on his feet again and about to reinstall the fuses , however , he hesitated ."
"`` I'm going to turn my generator back on , as I promised to do ."
First I've got to intercept my brothers before they get any deeper into trouble .
"I know it's not part of the bargain , and your elders might not like it '' ."
"`` Nobody else can live in your hearth while I am in it '' , Hesperus said promptly ."
"`` As for my elders , they have already admitted that they were wrong ."
"With a short-lived sigh of relief , Jack plugged the fuses back in and threw the switch ."
"Without an instant's transition , the green light that meant full fusion power winked on the board ."
"`` Hesperus , don't use this t-tau vector trick of yours , please ."
"`` Nothing wrong with me that couldn't be cured '' , Nogol said ."
he had been explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself .
His small black eyes darted inside the olive oval of his face .
"`` Well , let's take a ground-level look at the country around here '' ."
"A range of bluffs hugged the horizon , the color of decaying moss ."
"These planets were much bigger , nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere ."
"But to the infuriation of scientists , for no known reason not all of them did ."
`` How can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely '' ? ?
"He was the captain , so he could ask questions like that ."
"`` Some can be lonely in a crowd '' , Nogol said elaborately ."
This old world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago .
"`` Ekstrohm , you and I will have a look '' , Ryan said ."
"Me , I know the mind of an officer works in a strange and unfathomable manner '' ."
Positive results start when it goes towards the hand you use to make your mark '' .
The strong negative field his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insects .
He wasn't likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever .
"It was day , but in the thin atmosphere contrasts were sharp between light and shadow ."
"In the meantime , we might be thinking on the problem all these dead beasts represent ."
"`` It looks like we did , when we made blastdown '' ."
`` But what about our landing was lethal to the creatures '' ? ?
They curl up and die at the sight of something strange and alien -- like a spaceship '' .
"Suppose it is something right on the planet , native to it ."
"Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and thought , the camp is quiet ."
"There was a keening of wind , and a cracking of the frozen ground ."
The bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on board .
"He threw off the light blanket and swung his feet off the bunk , to the floor ."
"He no longer had to lie in his bunk all night , his eyes closed , pretending to sleep ."
"In privacy he could walk around , leave the light on , read ."
"Actually , they said , he did sleep , but so shortly and fitfully that he forgot ."
His body processes only slowed down enough for him to dispell fatigue poisons .
"Insomnia would ground him from the Exploration Service , on physiological if not psychological grounds ."
"Over the years , he had had buddies in space in whom he thought he could confide ."
"Since he couldn't sleep anyway , he might as well stand their watches for them or write their reports ."
"In a camp , instead of shipboard , hiding the secret was easier ."
Ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a banging on the hatch of his bubble .
"`` Okay , Stormy , this isn't the place for fun and games ."
"`` Listen , Ekstrohm , I want to give you the benefit of every doubt ."
"But you aren't exactly the model of a surveyor , you know ."
"You've been riding on a pink ticket for six years , you know that '' ."
"`` No '' , Ekstrohm said , `` No , I didn't know that '' ."
`` You've been hiding things from me and Nogol every jump we've made with you .
It fits the pattern of secrecy and stealth you've been involved in '' .
"Now all the bodies are missing , like they got up and walked away '' ."
"`` Ryan , there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies ."
I outweigh you fifty pounds and I'm fast for a big man '' .
Why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong ? ?
She was not alone for there were three other such children in the big city's special nursery .
Soon they all were removed to Central Laboratory School where their delicate transformation began .
"Instead of kicking feet , Helva's neural responses started her wheels ; ;"
Her initial intelligence tests registered above normal and her adaptation index was unusually high .
"Brain ships were , of course , long past the experimental stages ."
She would one day be grateful to the patient drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction .
One such group got all incensed over shelled `` children '' when Helva was just turning fourteen .
"Helva's class was doing Fine Arts , a selective subject in her crowded program ."
Shell people used their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound issued through microphones rather than mouths .
"Helva's hum then had a curious vibrancy , a warm , dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic wanderings ."
"`` Why , what a lovely voice you have '' , said one of the female visitors ."
"`` Yes , we have quite a few years of voice training , madam '' , remarked Helva calmly ."
`` Vocal peculiarities often become excessively irritating during prolonged intra-stellar distances and must be eliminated .
"Although this was the first time that Helva had seen unshelled people , she took this experience calmly ."
"`` I meant that you have a nice singing voice dear '' , the lady amended ."
She instinctively sheered away from personal discussions but she filed the comment away for further meditation .
`` I am currently reproducing the Last Supper on the head of a screw '' .
Helva turned her vision back to magnification and surveyed her copy critically .
"`` Oh , I forget '' , and Helva's voice was really contrite ."
The monitor of this discourse grinned with pride and amusement as Helva's tone indicated pity for the unfortunate .
"`` Did they remember to program a sense of humor , as well , young lady '' ? ?"
"`` We are directed to develop a sense of proportion , sir , which contributes the same effect '' ."
The good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip was worth his time .
But `` singing '' for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties to be overcome .
Shell people were schooled to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before making a prognosis .
"She would work out a method , by-passing her limitations , whereby she could sing ."
"She approached the problem by investigating the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries , human and instrumental ."
"After experimentation , Helva discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain tone ."
Acquiring a repertoire from the Laboratory library was no problem to one trained to perfect recall .
She found herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy .
"If the authorities remarked on her curious avocation , they did so among themselves ."
Shell people were encouraged to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency in their technical work .
"The neural , audio , visual and sensory connections were made and sealed ."
She was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner .
There were nine qualified scouts sitting around collecting base pay the day Helva was commissioned .
Consequently no one had remembered to introduce Helva to the prospective partners .
"`` Of course '' , replied Helva logically , activating her outside scanners ."
"`` All you have to do is ask '' , he retorted hopefully ."
I thought perhaps there were no partners available and I've had no directives from Central '' .
"Always she had had the company of other shells and more recently , technicians by the score ."
B'dikkat had turned to the next knot of people when the super-condamine hit Mercer .
It was foolish and snobbish to wear clothing when none of these nice people did .
He wondered how anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet as nice as this .
"He tried to tell the Lady Da , but the words weren't quite straight ."
"It was like the cap in the hospital , only a thousand times better ."
"The pain was gone , though it had been crippling the first time ."
The Lady Da forced the foremost of her bodies in an upright position .
"We can die , too , we can die like real people ."
With this he felt his lips thicken and his mind go slack .
"He was wide awake , but he did not feel like doing anything ."
"In that beautiful place , among all those companionable and attractive people , he sat and smiled ."
"The agonies of nerves and itching of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near him , but meant nothing ."
After a long time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his powerful arms .
"She meant him well , but was in no condition for articulate speech ."
"The half-man lay on the ground , arteries pulsating prettily behind the half-transparent film which protected his abdominal cavity ."
"The half-man woke , recognized Mercer and gave him a healthily sleepy grin ."
"`` I never saw that '' , said Mercer , `` but I '' --"
`` But you want to ask me when B'dikkat is going to come back with the needle '' .
"`` Yes '' , said Mercer , a little ashamed of his obviousness ."
But we never know how long a scene is going to take '' .
I'm inclined to think that they are about two Earth-weeks each '' .
Mercer himself could not tell how long it was before B'dikkat came back .
"Lady Da smiled at him often , but there was no love in this place ."
"In between teratologies , she was a pretty and shapely woman ; ;"
"She found this immensely comforting , even though Mercer did not make much sense out of it ."
"Thus events occurred , and victims changed in appearance , and new ones arrived ."
The bodies in the truck threshed and bawled without human speech when the dromozoa struck them .
"Finally , Mercer did manage to follow B'dikkat to the door of the cabin ."
"B'dikkat grudgingly agreed , but he did not come out of the doorway ."
"Mercer , despite his happiness , wept a little at the strange fate of B'dikkat ."
He remembered the last time he had eaten -- actual eggs from an actual pan .
"The dromozoa kept him alive , but he did not know how they did it ."
Sometimes the bubbling sound of geysers came faintly across the plain to the herd of men ; ;
those who could talk declared it to be the breathing of Captain Alvarez .
"Her statement was a hope , not a truth in which they could believe ."
"Far long ago , some other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter ."
"The letter , scraped on stone , had been a message home ."
"Once , like you , I had one head , two hands , ten fingers on my hands ."
"The front part of my head was called a face , and I could talk with it ."
"Now I can only write , and that only when I get out of pain ."
"If he had married her , he'd have been asking for trouble ."
The best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work .
"each day the hurt was a little duller , a little less poignant ."
"Because the summer was unusually dry and hot , the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years ."
"The grass in the meadows came fast , now that the warm weather was here ."
"When they were closer and he saw that one was a woman , he was more puzzled than ever ."
"He cleaned his shovel , left it against the fence , picked up his Winchester , and started downstream ."
"His visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow , angling toward the house ."
"Reaching the house ahead of them , he waited with his Winchester in his hands ."
"She lay there , making no effort to get back on her feet ."
"Morgan hesitated , thinking that if this was a trick , it was a good one ."
He didn't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending .
"Leaning his Winchester against the front of the house , he walked to the girl ."
Her eyes were glazed as if she didn't hear or even see him .
She had reached a point at which she didn't even care how she looked .
"She was amazingly light , and so relaxed in his arms that he wasn't even sure she was conscious ."
Any lingering suspicion that this was a trick Al Budd had thought up was dispelled .
No girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him .
"Both had blonde hair and blue eyes , and there was even a faint similarity of features ."
"She drank greedily , and murmured , `` Thank you '' , as he lowered her head ."
"He stood looking down at her for a moment , wondering what could have reduced her to this condition ."
"He brought his Winchester in from the front of the house , then faced the boy ."
We ran out of money and we haven't eaten for two days '' .
"`` We've been looking for work , but all the ranchers have turned us down '' ."
"They might kill him in his sleep , thinking there was money in the house ."
"He hadn't shaved for several weeks , his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic , woebegone expression ."
"He'd be an idiot to let them stay he thought , but he couldn't send them on , either ."
"`` We'll work for our keep '' , the boy said eagerly ."
"Morgan filled the fire box with wood again , then started supper and set the table ."
"She rubbed her eyes and stretched , then sat up , her hands going to her hair ."
"`` I'm a mess '' , she said , and suddenly she was alarmed ."
"You fell down in front of the house , and I carried you in ."
I gave you a drink and then you went to sleep '' .
"She stared at him , her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said ; ;"
Do you take in all the strays who come by '' ? ?
"`` I don't have many strays coming to my front door '' , he said ."
He caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen .
"I'm usually a very strong woman , but I'm awfully tired '' ."
"It's not much of a meal , but it's what I eat '' ."
"`` Mr. Morgan , it's the best-looking food I ever saw '' ."
He told himself he had never seen two people eat so much .
"When they were finally satisfied , Jones said , `` I think he's going to give us work '' ."
The grateful way she looked at Morgan made him ashamed of himself .
"When he saw the expression in her eyes , he knew he couldn't send them on ."
"She said , `` I guess the Lord looks out for fools , drunkards , and innocents '' ."
He carried the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the wall .
He said : `` You'll feel a lot better after you have a bath .
"`` No , she'll be all right '' , Jones said quickly ."
"He nodded and , going into the bedroom , brought a needle , thread , and scissors ."
"The bed isn't made , but you'll find plenty of blankets there '' ."
"Jones followed him into the front room , closing the door behind him ."
"I just can't take any chances on getting her pregnant , and if we were sleeping together ''"
"They were a pair of lost , whipped kids , Morgan thought as he went to bed ."
It was the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt .
Clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known .
Gavin's lips moved so that Clayton had to stoop to catch the words .
"He got into a fight with Tom English , your brother's son ."
"It was a fair fight , the boy provoked it -- Big Charlie told me so ."
"They killed Big Charlie , dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago ."
"He wiped his lips with a sleeve , then stared at Clayton in a childish kind of wonder ."
"Clayton choked , shook his head , murmuring , `` No '' ."
The old man beckoned with one finger and Clayton went forward to him .
"`` All my life '' , he said , `` I tried ."
And you wanted no part of me when I had so much to give .
"Can't let you go way from me again '' He closed his eyes , ashamed of his tears ."
He burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air .
When he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch .
"The stallion had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf , shaking his head ."
Clayton looped the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck .
"`` Clay '' , he said , `` where are we goin '' ? ?"
"Start out fresh , the two of us , like nothin had ever happened '' ."
He approached the horse and laid a hand on the stallion's quivering neck .
"`` Lived alone here for three years , before any man came ."
In that inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind .
"He saw them ambushed , strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying ."
They passed ranches that were framed dark gray against the black hills .
"The men in Pettigrew's were tired from a night's drinking , their faces red and baggy ."
"They greeted the news angrily , as though they had been cheated of purpose ."
"You see , he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone '' ."
"He remembered Gavin's smirk , his own cringing feeling , his impotence ."
Then he thought of a time when Clayton's horse had fallen lame in the Gap .
His wife had said to him : `` Nellie is in love with Clayton Roy .
And you stand by like a fool and let him do it ''
It was the night Clayton had tricked them in the poker game .
`` You brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find your boy .
He swung round to the other men -- `` We can catch him easy ! !
They mounted up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance .
The mare began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of Gavin's stallion .
"And he was fleeing , running -- fleeing his death and his life at the same time ."
The land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in : his valley .
He had been carrying an Enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball pistol .
"He and Dean tied and gagged the man , using his belt and shirt for the purpose ."
"`` I never felt better in my life '' , Fiske blustered ."
"`` The main bunch is outside , but there are some over there inside the wall '' ."
"Mike debated it , trying to decide whether Fiske was strong enough to ride ."
"And , for the sake of Julia and Susan , it had to be tried ."
"About a dozen animals were held inside the stockade , as best Mike could make out in the moonlight ."
Evidently this was a precaution so that mounts would be available in an emergency .
"`` Dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride '' , he said ."
"She clung to him , talking to him , and dabbing at her eyes ."
`` Running around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock '' ? ?
"And using him , Mike McLish , as a sop to her pride ."
"Holding the pistol concealed , he walked to the rear wall of the stockade ."
Mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses .
The guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight .
Mike kept walking and got within arm's reach before the man became suspicious and straightened from his lax slouch .
He tried to veer the rifle around to fire into Mike's body .
"Mike , off balance , managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded ."
"The sentry's saddled horse stood picketed nearby , having been kept handy in case of need ."
Mike took the bayonet from Dean's hand and slashed the picket line .
The rest of us can fort up in the house and hang on until you get back .
"`` No telling how good this horse is '' , Mike panted ."
"We'll still have the rifle , and I might be able to round up some more ."
I'll stampede the rest of these horses so they can't chase you '' .
Dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back .
"Mike ran down the line , slashing picket ropes with the bayonet ."
"The animals thundered away into the moonlight , heading for the ridges ."
The guerrillas were swarming from their bivouac at the west end of the enclosure .
"All were carrying guns they had seized up , but they were half-clad or hardly clad at all ."
He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner .
"Ducking inside , he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner ."
"A brace of pistols , holstered on belts , hung from a peg , along with ammunition pouches ."
"An ammunition case stood open , containing canisters which contained powder cartridges ."
"He looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons , struck by a new inspiration ."
"Snatching the lantern from its peg , he shattered its globe with a blow against a post ."
He turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house .
One struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack .
"Its force spun him around , but he recovered and got into stride again ."
A bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety .
Susan and Julia came from the door and dragged him with them .
The three of them floundered through the door into the interior and fell in a heap .
"She crouched aside as bullets beat at the portal , chewing into the planks ."
"The iron hinges held , but the planks were in danger of being torn from the crossbars ."
"Mike rolled to Susan , grasped her around the knees , dragging her off her feet ."
"He hovered over her to shield her , for spent bullets were thudding against the rear walls ."
Mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fired .
At the same moment Wheeler Fiske fired the rifle Mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit .
The guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring .
"Many of them , in increasing panic , came running with water in their hats in a ludicrous effort ."
The wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings .
Susan and Julia ripped strips from their clothing and bound the injury .
Mike tested the leg and found that he was able to hobble around on it .
`` So it wasn't the earthquake that made him return to his village '' ! !
"Now dammit , I don't want to go into any more explanations ."
He brushed past the clergyman and walked into the center of the camp .
"Using his hands as a trumpet he shouted , `` Fort up ! !"
"For a second , engages , cooks , voyageurs appeared struck dumb ."
"`` That was a terrible thing to do '' , I said to Oso ."
And here all the time you knew the Sioux would be using our rifles on them ! !
"`` Old Knife's got the largest war party ever seen on the river '' , he said calmly ."
That's why the British never got the tribes to fight for the King .
Then he went on to the Cheyennes and told them that the Sioux was goin' to move up .
The War Department wrote Mr. Manuel a letter and said he was a hero .
He carried it in a little wallet made of fish skin '' .
In this country there's a war on every time the grass turns green .
"First it was the Nations against themselves , then it was them against the whites ."
I remember being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place overnight .
-- Old Knife's not the only chief he'll get to do his dirty work ! !
Before we get through he'll have the Blackfeet hankerin' for our hair and our goods .
"Well , talkin' ain't goin' to help -- let's fort up '' ! !"
"Still , I was disgusted with myself for agreeing with Montero's methods ."
"But Oso replied calmly , `` Trouble ain't easy to dodge out in this country , rev'rend '' ."
Gray Eyes attacked our camp just as the first pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky .
the Rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible .
Wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors .
"Every time I closed my eyes , I saw Gray Eyes rushing at me with a knife ."
"`` Oso '' , Montero called `` I'll get Gray Eyes '' ."
"At first they were only feathers and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies , hunched over their horses' heads ."
"His face was split by a vermilion streak , his eyes were pools of white ; ;"
"His mouth was open , his neck corded with the strain of his screams ."
"As he started to slump over , another warrior swung him onto his horse ."
He started to run but Oso's shot caught him on the wing .
What else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire on all sides .
Far up the valley I could see the Rees circling and reorganizing .
A horse screamed as it twisted from side to side in a frenzy .
"His legs pumped furiously , his long black hair streamed out behind him ."
"`` For Christ's sake , don't waste your powder on one of 'em '' ! !"
The war captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat .
"He was riding between two warriors , who held him erect when he started to slump ."
"This time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically , but they held their fire ."
Our rolling volley swept most of the other riders from their mounts .
I heard the whir of an ax and a Canadian's face burst apart in a bloody spray .
I saw Little Billy rise and fire almost point blank and an Indian's face became shattered flesh and bone .
"Oso reached up , jerked the buck from the bale and snapped his neck ."
"Other Indians were running at the ponies , shrilling and waving blankets ."
The pall of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the Aricaras charged again .
"A small Indian dived at Montero , who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt ."
Above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales .
"Although my shot killed his horse , he rolled off the bale on top of me ."
"His eyes were dark , fluid , fearful , and he gave a sigh as my knife went in ."
In the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song .
`` You could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size .
And make sure it's out when you leave in the morning '' .
"It's bigger than it has to be , though I don't see where it's doing any harm ."
"Then she turned back to Wilson and smiled , and he wasn't quite sure what she meant by it ."
"She said , and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly ."
She had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him .
It's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of .
"`` It wouldn't matter to my father , and not to me ."
"`` I don't mind washing dishes now and then '' , he said pleasantly ."
"He meant to say more , but he never got the chance ."
"She brought the quirt down , slashing it across his cheek , and he tried to step back ."
"She came down against him , and he tried to break her fall ."
"It made him a little sick , and he let go of her ."
"He got up slowly , and she was already on her feet , and he stood facing her ."
"He was shaking with anger , his breath coming in long , painful gasps ."
"`` That quirt -- I ought to use it on you , where it would do the most good ."
"The fire had gone down , and the man was only a shadow against the trees ."
"And he was handsome , despite the long thin scar that slanted across his cheek ."
"`` Put the rifle down , Joseph '' , the girl said ."
The half-breed eased the Winchester down and rested it across his lap .
"`` You shouldn't be riding up here after dark , Judith '' , he said quietly ."
The girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee and glared at him .
"They could hear the pony's feet on the dry leaves for a while , then the sound faded out ."
"`` He works for my father '' , the girl said , and then seemed to change her mind ."
"`` Oh , no '' , he said , and he was without humor now ."
"I don't know what goes on around here , and I don't care ."
"She brought up her free hand to hit him , but this time he was quicker ."
"He side-stepped her blow and she fell , stumbling against the gelding ."
"They weren't sleeping , of course , but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending ."
"He hadn't shown up too well in their eyes , letting himself be browbeaten by a woman ."
"They expected greater things from him , regardless of how trying the circumstances , and they were disappointed ."
"They lay a little too stiffly , with their eyes straining to stay closed ."
"I'll be down at the creek finishing the dishes , if you want me '' ."
He found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream .
"If she did , he could stand it better in the light ."
He scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans and reflected on how things had turned out .
There would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief .
"And they had almost everything they needed : land , a house , two whiteface bulls , three horses ."
"Six hundred and forty acres , the old man back in St. Louis had said ; ;"
"The water was there , so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard ."
"In the last analysis , though , Wilson had little cause to complain ."
There was only one place where Jake Carwood's description had gone badly awry : the peace and quiet .
"Wilson backed the team into the traces , and wished they weren't going to town at all ."
It was the only thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember .
He finished with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him .
"Yes , there was plenty of water , too much , and that was probably the trouble ."
There were tracks of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres .
"It was hotter once they reached the flat , and drier , but the grass was better ."
It took them an hour before they came to the first houses of Kelseyville .
Such was my state of mind that I did not question the possibility of this ; ;
"I went to the hall in the afternoons only , on these preliminary matters ."
only the counter at one end was lighted by a long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it .
"A glimpse of three of four vague figures , at the most ."
"Since they could see me but I not them , their presence in the hall disturbed me ."
"This impressed me , until I realized how limited was his sphere of influence ."
"His authority extended to the far edge of the counter , no further ."
None of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak to him .
"He spoke to me in a gruff voice , an affectation which quite belied his personality ."
"He wore his white shirt open at the neck , revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest underneath ."
It was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was .
"The morning's tabloids were on the counter , and a stack of dog-eared men's magazines ."
"He would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence , then bark into it with gruff importance ."
"He couldn't afford to have anyone mess around with them , he said ."
Each of those tickets was of great value to its rightful recipient .
Later I would remember what this pompous little man had told me about the worth of a ticket .
The presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air .
Also the clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder .
It sprang from a type of mentality I'd encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here .
I decided to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed .
I could not cling to my past nor did I wish to .
Although I had been inside it I had not yet seen it functioning .
I wished to prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes I ought to be wearing .
I was constantly searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall .
The river was only a few blocks away but an unbroken line of piers prevented me from seeing it .
Sometimes I noticed the tops of ships' masts and funnels reaching above the pier roofs .
"The sounds issuing from beyond -- winches whirring , men shouting -- indicated great activity and excited me ."
"The hall , on the other hand , appeared lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront afternoons ."
But it was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it .
"I returned to the hall , despite my dislike for the clerk ."
"I could consult this personage on any weekday morning , though not before ten o'clock ."
The clerk impressed this upon me : that I should not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock .
When I went for my interview with the director I saw why .
I had felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs .
The staircase itself seemed still to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men .
"He was a man in his late forties , with graying hair , of medium height ; ;"
"he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit , brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar ."
they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance routine any moment .
"I had the impression that he had read my forms , perhaps several times ."
He had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there ; ;
"indeed , my scholastic qualifications were such that he , a college graduate himself , must envy me them ."
"Was I sure , he asked , that I knew what I was applying for ? ?"
"What sort of men I would come into contact with , at the hall ? ?"
"Though I doubted that he would understand me , I told the director my motives for applying ."
"I had always , I said , hankered after working hard with my hands ."
To this effect I had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence .
"The flat , hard cap was small , but he thrust it to the back of his head ."
"The man went over without sound , falling to the bare floor ."
"Barton said harshly , `` Why did you do that '' ? ?"
"`` What did you want me to do , kiss him ? ?"
If you ever try anything without my orders I'll kill you '' .
"They filed out through the guard-room door , into the paved square ."
"They moved slowly , toward the main gate , following the wall ."
"`` It's Curtiss '' , he said , naming the man Rankin had hit ."
As he passed through it Barton shoved his gun against the man's side .
"Deliberately , with none of Rankin's viciousness , he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the guard's head ."
"They slid through the wicket in the big gate , ghosted across the dark ground ."
Barton was relieved to see that Carl Dill and Emmett Foster had brought extra mounts .
He had been worried that with Miller and Rankin added to the escape party they would be short .
"In a small grove against the river they halted , turning deep into the protection of the trees ."
"He had been one of the original Night Riders , one who had escaped the trial ."
It was to him that Barton had sent Carl Dill on Dill's release from the prison .
"Kid Boyd was unusually silent , Rankin watchful , a few paces apart ."
"He said in a studied voice , `` I didn't do it for you ."
"Barton turned away , his eyes falling upon Rankin beside his horse ."
"He did not trust Rankin , his violent temper , his killer instinct ."
"They were in a fight , outweighed in both numbers and money ."
"`` Your choice '' , he said briefly , and turned to Kid Boyd ."
"Then Barton touched Carl Dill's arm and moved off , up the river bank ."
"He wanted a careful , uninterrupted report from Dill on the conditions in the valley ."
"He too knew the agony of going for weeks , sometimes months without the solace of tobacco ."
Through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly .
"For his first five years in prison , they had shared a cell ."
"He said now , `` I've got the perfect headquarters set up ."
Then the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned .
A company of cavalry couldn't come in there if two men were guarding that trail '' .
"But Kruger's men keep them off balance , and they don't trust me ."
"When they learn you're in the hills though , they'll rally , don't worry about that '' ."
"Barton waited for a long moment , then asked the question which lay always uppermost in his mind ."
`` Your sister-in-law has the faro bank in Cap Ayres' saloon '' .
"After another long pause he asked , `` How many people know who they are '' ? ?"
It brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences .
"The office was of logs , four rooms , each heated by an iron stove ."
"The gravel was the bed of an ancient river , buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of earth ."
"Their roar , like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could be heard for miles ."
"He was a big man , wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill air ."
"The man was tall , thin , with a narrow face and a too-large nose ."
Kodyke had appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from Kruger .
He supervised the cleanups and handled the shipments of raw gold which each week went out to San Francisco .
He pulled open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a tintype .
"Kodyke took the picture in a lean hand , studying it thoughtfully ."
It cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them .
"The gunman nodded , slipping the picture into his breast pocket , saying nothing ."
"If she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother , she did not comment upon it ."
She must be cautious so as not to alert the scheming forest .
"She locked the ignition , removed the keys , stepped out of the car and went into the house ."
"Here , she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom ."
"Atonement , if atonement were possible , could only be made at that sacred , sacrificial basin ."
"It was there that she would have to enact her renunciation , beg forgiveness ."
"The forest was open and freely welcoming , extending an enchanted hand ."
The ground was covered with soft pine needles and the slope was gentle .
"It was not , thought Pamela , such an evil place after all ."
Perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed .
"A few days ago , she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous ; ;"
She did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail ; ;
she directed all of her mental and physical energy toward achieving this one goal .
"If the slope grew steeper and the groves more dim , she tried not to heed ."
knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man .
"In her grim pursuit of tranquillity , Pamela focused her thoughts on her husband ."
How could he comprehend her need when he himself was innocent ? ?
The mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine needles .
"The trees huddled more closely together , their limbs and leaves intertwined in a coarse curtain against the sun ."
"Silence walked at Pamela's side , its presence numbingly close , yet too far for her to hear ."
"Silence stood in front of her , waiting , and in back of her , blocking her retreat ."
She stumbled over the root of a tree that protruded maliciously above the earth .
She started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes .
"Her arm bled slightly , and the offended skin cried out in pain ."
"The trees were crowded so closely together that their branches overlapped , virtually shutting out the sun completely ."
Where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined such a scene ? ?
"She already knew this unwholesome , chilling atmosphere that was somehow grotesquely alive ."
"It crawled across her breasts , suffocating the life in her nipples ."
stifled her lungs so that her breath came in harsh gasps ; ;
"The shadows of the trees engulfed her , foreclosing every possible exit from the grove ."
She had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around her throat in ever-tightening circles .
She had to move in some direction -- any direction that would take her away from this evil place .
She thrust forward through the shadows and the trees that resisted her and tried to fling her back .
"She began it deliberately , so that none of her words would be lost on him ."
"`` To me you'll always be the girl o' my dreams , an' the sweetest flower that grows '' ."
"Beaming idiotically , he pooched out his lips and attempted to kiss her ."
"I think you're mean and hateful and stupid , and -- louder '' ? ?"
Looks like we might be in for a speck of trouble '' .
"He waited at the car side for a moment , looking down at her expectantly ."
"Print it in real big letters , an' I can cipher it out later '' ."
"He grinned , nodded , and walked around to the front of the car ."
"Lips pursed mournfully , he stared down at its crazily sagging left side ."
"He went prone on his stomach , the better to pursue his examination ."
He wore no gun -- a strange ommission for a peace officer in this country .
"Never , he'd once told Joyce , had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun ."
against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis .
"He was handsome , with his coal-black hair and eyes , his fine-chiseled features ."
And his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance .
Just so darned sure of himself that he puts the Indian sign on everyone .
"But , by gosh , I want him and I'm going to have him ! !"
"He caught her eye , came back around the car with the boot-wearer ; ;"
`` Can't you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute '' ? ?
`` Or maybe you just don't feel like a cigar '' ? ?
"`` I feel like getting back to town , that's what I feel like ! !"
"Now , are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk '' ? ?"
"She saw it then , the distant derrick of the wildcat -- a test well in unexplored country ."
"He had to depend on himself , since he was invariably miles and hours away from others ."
"`` Why , I meant what I said '' , Lord declared ."
"In his mood , it was the best way to handle him ; ;"
"Along with this self-satisfaction , however , Joyce sensed a growing tension ."
McBride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip .
"It was payday for Highlands , and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields ."
"I'm not the only man in town with a gun , or the only one without a permit '' ."
The deputy had forced him to by his manner of accosting him .
"`` Well , I'll tell you about that '' , Lord told him ."
Figger we got to be plumb careful with any of you Highlands big shots '' .
"`` I know you've got a grudge against me , and maybe I can't blame you ."
You think that Highlands swindled you and I helped 'em do it .
An' that could mean trouble with a fella that's workin' for crooks .
"So you get rid of that pistol right now , Mis-ter McBride ."
You do that or take you out a permit right now '' .
"`` I'll get around to it a little later '' , he mumbled desperately ."
"`` Just as soon as I go to the bank , and '' --"
"It was strictly the deputy's game , but McBride had gone too far to throw in ."
"Now , he could only play the last card in what was probably the world's coldest deck ."
"He flung off Lord's hand and attempted to push past him , inadvertently shoving him into a storefront ."
It was practically the last move that McBride made of his own volition .
"Lord slugged him in the stomach , so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine ."
"And then there was a numbing blow to the heart , and another gut-flattening blow to the stomach"
"And he could no longer think of face-saving , of honor , but only of escape ."
"I was just doing my job , just following orders , and for that he's going to kill me ."
"McBride staggered into the street , flopped sprawling in the stinging dust ."
"Fear-maddened , fleeing the lengthening shadow of death , he scrambled to his feet again ."
"Dimly , he heard laughter , hoots of derision , but he could not read the racket properly ."
He hated them too much to understand -- the people of this isolated law-unto-itself world that was Lord's world .
"This , he was sure , was the way they would act ; ;"
"laughing at a dying man , laughing as a man was beaten to death ."
"Donna , his young wife , the girl who was both daughter and wife to him ."
"She lived by the rules , never compromising , never blinded or diverted by circumstance ."
The Brannon outfit -- known as the Slash-B because of its brand -- reached Hondo Creek before sundown .
The rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and turned them into the remuda .
"There was some idle talk , a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day's drive ."
"The cook , Mateo Garcia , had arrived there long before the herd ."
He was readying a batch of sourdough biscuits for the Dutch oven .
Billie had unhitched the mules from both Tom Brannon's and his father's wagon .
"Hank had gathered wood for a cookfire , and his wife was busy at it now ."
"Conchita nagged at the younger children , attempting without success to keep her thoughts off Tom Brannon ."
He'd been in an angry mood : Conchita had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him .
"She wondered what had taken place in town , between him and his wife ."
"Not that her mother knew what had happened , but they could speculate upon it ."
"Even as she called to the children , Conchita let her gaze seek Tom Brannon ."
"He was in earnest conversation with her father and the old vaquero , Luis Hernandez ."
"At the moment , the three men were not saying much of anything ."
"They were sitting on their heels , rider-fashion , over by the still empty calf wagon ."
"They were considering it gravely , neither seeming to like what he planned ."
"Finally Hernandez said , `` I could offer you advice , Tomas , but you wouldn't heed it '' ."
"After all , you want the senora as much as you want the boy ."
`` And the boy will be too much under his influence by then .
I've got to take Danny away from Clayton before I lose him altogether .
`` But to take him and leave his mother behind is not good '' .
"`` In my place , you'd follow such advice as you give me '' ? ?"
"`` That I can't answer , for I can't imagine something like this happening to me ."
"Like Luis , I can't see something like this happening to me ."
"Where I go , she goes -- and the kids with us ."
"Finally Luis Hernandez said , `` What must be , must be ."
"And Hank Maguire added , `` So am I , Tom '' ."
Brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall .
"Later , they'd heard the rumble of thunder and then , just outside Rockfork , they ran into rain ."
"The others put on old coats or ducking jackets , whichever they carried behind their saddle cantles ."
"There were seven of them , enough for a show of strength -- to run a bluff ."
"With him were Hank Maguire , Luis Hernandez , and Luis's son Pedro ."
"Also because of the storm , the streets of Rockfork were deserted ."
"They reined in before the town marshal's office , a box-sized building on Main Street ."
"A lamp burned inside , but Brannon , peering through the window , saw that the office was empty ."
"`` Not there '' , he said , getting back onto his horse ."
"They rode to the Rockfork House , a little farther along the opposite side of the street ."
He'd put on his old brown corduroy coat and it was already soaked .
He hardly noticed the blue-green flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder .
"Hogan reappeared , stopped on the hotel porch , lifted a hand in signal ."
"He and Hogan waited by the door , one to either side ."
"Macklin was the third man to come out , and he came unhurriedly ."
"He was puffing on a cigar , and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain ."
"They closed in fast , kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun ."
"`` Let's go , Marshal '' , Brannon said , and took him by the arm ."
They escorted him down from the porch and through the rain to his office .
"The other five Slash-B men followed them inside , crowding the small room ."
His face was stiff with anger when they let go of his arms .
"He looked at each of them in turn , Brannon last of all ."
"Brannon said , `` Now the key to the lockup , Marshal '' ."
"No man laid a hand on him , but the threat of violence was there ."
"He held out a moment longer , then his nerve gave under the pressure ."
"Then , as Macklin obeyed : `` Now let's go out back '' ."
They followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear .
The door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded with strap iron .
"Macklin balked again , not wanting to unlock and open the door ."
"They crowded him in that threatening way once more , forced him to give in ."
"Once the door was open , they crowded him inside the dark building ."
He was uttering threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked the door .
"He came to the edge of the veranda , peered down at them with his hand on his gun ."
`` Don't get yourself killed for something that doesn't concern you '' .
Miguel and Arturo Ramirez remained on the veranda to keep Harper from interfering .
For men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had received no second .
"For , with a single exception , nothing had happened to them ."
"A split second later , the distant crack of a rifle had sounded ."
But he had found all of the thickets and points of cover deserted .
Lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of cow stealing .
"He was a man , those neighbors testified later , who didn't have a friend in the world ."
"He had his chance the very next morning , for exactly the same thing happened again ."
"He found nothing , but he still refused to give up and move out ."
`` Just let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin' coward face-to-face '' ! !
"For the unseen , ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the third time ."
"He slumped against a log fence rail , then tried to lift himself ."
"Two more shots followed in quick succession , dropping him limp and huddled on the ground ."
"He was finally found in the Bates Hole region of Natrona County , two counties away ."
Prosecutor Baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment .
"`` Dead center at three hundred yards , that coroner said '' ! !"
`` Three shots in that fella 'fore he hit the ground ! !
You reckon there's two men in this state can shoot like that '' ? ?
"Privately , he created and magnified an image of himself as a hired assassin ."
"Tom Horn was soon back at work , giving his secret employers their money's worth ."
"Even in the very area where the shooting had been done , cattle were still disappearing ."
"Haying time was close at hand , and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack ."
"He looked around in surprise , then noticed that Fred Powell was clutching his chest ."
"`` Exterminatin' cow thieves is just a business proposition with me '' , he'd blandly announce ."
`` And I sort o' got a corner on the market '' .
"`` Tom '' , a friend asked him once , `` how come you bushwhacked them rustlers ? ?"
"They wouldn't o' stood no chance with you in a plain , straight-out shoot-down '' ."
No man's name brought more cheers when it was announced in a rodeo .
"`` Well '' , he explained , `` s'posin' you was a nester swingin' the long rope ? ?"
Which would you be most scairt of -- a dry-gulchin' or a shoot-down '' ? ?
"`` Yeah , I can see that '' , the friend was forced to agree ."
"`` But well , it just don't seem sportin' somehow '' ! !"
"After the first two murders , the warning notes were rarely ignored ."
"All through Albany and Laramie counties , other men were doing the same ."
The small half-heartedly tended fields of men who'd spent more time rustling cattle than farming were lying fallow .
No cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer .
) Rumor had it he slipped two small rocks under each victim's head as a sort of trademark .
( A detailed search of old coroner's reports fails to substantiate this in the slightest .
"`` My reputation's my stock in trade '' , Tom mentioned more than once ."
He evidently couldn't foresee that it might be his downfall in the end .
He had made himself the personification of the Devil to the homesteaders .
"He made their spreads his headquarters , and he helped out in their roundups ."
"The wailing , guitar-strumming minstrels of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him ."
"`` What is it you want me to do , Mr. Brenner '' ? ?"
"`` It doesn't seem quite right , telling her a thing like that ."
He turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he hadn't before noticed .
"If someone were to drop a match in here , this place would go up like a haystack '' ."
Curt's visit to the livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching .
A man like Jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed .
From the back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach Black's house without using the street .
"Curt approached the place cautiously , and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees ."
"There was a light in Black's front room , but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior ."
"There was no lock on the door , only an iron hook which he unfastened ."
"He opened the door and went in , pulling it shut behind him ."
"He moved ahead carefully , his left hand in front of him , and came to a wooden partition ."
"Horse smell was very strong , and he could hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws ."
"There were two horses in the barn , a sway-backed dun and Jess Crouch's buckskin ."
"It was certain now that Jess was in the house , but also , presumably , was Stacey Black ."
He studied the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved .
"Reaching across the side of the stall , he slapped the buckskin on the rump ."
The startled animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall .
"He slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly , its hoofs rattling the side of the stall ."
"Presently he heard footsteps crossing the yard , and Jess's smothered curses ."
Curt doubted that any animal belonging to Jess would find much reassurance in its owner's voice .
"As he crossed to the side of the stall , Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer ."
"He started to reach for his gun , but apparently thought better of it ."
He reached out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt .
"`` You and I have a little talking to do , Jess ."
"If I don't come back in the house , Breed's going to '' --"
That long ride the four of you took must've given him a good appetite .
"There was raw fury in his eyes , and the veins of his neck were swollen ."
"I don't know what you're up to , but when Brenner '' --"
"`` You can forget about Brenner , too '' , Curt said ."
"I suppose you don't know anything about a piece of two-by-four , either ; ;"
Curt's fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun .
"He drew back his arm to slash the gunbarrel across Jess's face , but didn't finish the motion ."
"Apparently sensing this , and realizing that it gave him an advantage , Jess became bold ."
"`` Having all the guns makes you a big man , don't it , Adams ? ?"
"If we was both armed , you wouldn't talk so tough '' ."
"The fingers of his right hand twisted into a claw , but he didn't reach for the gun ."
"Curt , angry enough to be a little reckless , raised his hands shoulder high ."
Jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides .
Curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention .
"`` We'll do it another way , then '' , he said harshly ."
Jess's coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by Curt's fist .
"Curt managed to duck beneath the man's flailing fist , and drove home a solid left to Jess's mid-section ."
"As it was , his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move ."
"When his eyes began to focus , he saw Jess charging at him with a pitchfork ."
"Curt twisted to one side , and the tines of the fork bit into the floor ."
"The building shook , setting the lantern to swaying , and the buckskin to pitching again ."
"Even Black's old crowbait began to snort , and from the house Black yelled , `` Jess ! !"
"He lurched drunkenly to his feet , lowered his head , and took one step away from the wall ."
Curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor .
"Curt was in almost as bad shape , but he wouldn't quit ."
"`` It was Brenner's idea '' , Jess mumbled , dabbing at his nose ."
He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble '' .
"`` You mean anyone who stood up for his rights '' , Curt said ."
"He let go of the shirt , and Jess slumped to the floor ."
"He shook loose straw out of the action , and placed the gun in his holster ."
"Curt opened the door , grabbed Black by the shoulder , and pulled him into the barn ."
"He shoved Black toward the stall , and pointed his pistol at Jess ."
"You're coming along peacefully , or I'll put a bullet in your leg '' ."
"Curt followed , reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it ."
"Black would have little trouble getting out , but it might delay him a few minutes ."
"Maybe if the marshal hears this himself , it'll make a difference ."
Over his shoulder he could see Max's loose grin and the Burnsides' glowering faces .
"`` Sally '' , admonished her mother , `` you've got all evening to visit with Dan ."
Mrs. Jackson's words recalled Dan to his lack of fitness for courting .
Dan could hear Clayton Burnside and Eben Jackson summing up their final reckoning for rental on the oxen .
"Soon as the Burnsides moved on , he'd lead Rex down by the river ; ;"
"He stooped , picked up his ruined hat , and pursed his lips thoughtfully ."
"From the way the wound in his head was itching , Dan knew that it would heal ."
"The Burnsides , now ready to roll , were purposefully deaf to his cry ."
"Nate turned his head , attempting to speak in a soothing voice ."
`` Me and you's trading hats so's you'll have something permanent to remember me by '' ! !
"By then Hez could see for himself , and so could the others ."
No sooner did they hear of Dan's injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action .
"After their supper , the evening turned into a regular `` Hoe-Down '' ."
"`` Not that it matters to me , being this far along '' ."
Rod gave her a warm pat on the shoulder before he replied .
"`` Come spring , you'll be kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too , gal '' ."
He looked down at his big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers .
"`` Don't reckon there's nobody out there , 'cept maybe Dan , who can outgrip me , Harmony '' ."
Not with the memory of her folks and the lost Conestoga still holding her close .
"No matter how many registry rocks they came to on this journey , each one exerted its own appeal ."
"For Matilda , it was the first she had known in many a night ."
"Gran Harrow exclaimed , watching their rippling muscles as Rod and Dan swung her up into the load ."
`` A body would swear I floated right up here on a cloud '' ! !
Rod and Dan released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed grins .
`` How's Sally like rubbin' agin that thar little ticklebrush ye're a-raising '' ? ?
Gran peered again at the week-old blond mustache shadowing Dan's upper lip .
"`` But honest-to-Betsy , I've seed more hair than that on a piece o' bacon '' ."
"`` My right leg's stiff as a board this morning '' , he replied ."
`` But the sun'll fry it out'n me onct we git to rolling '' .
The three men stepped out to the side to wait for Captain Clemens' signal .
"`` Wonder what made them hurry so '' , Rod drawled , giving Dan a sly wink ."
"`` Ain't no sense you eating our dust '' , Rod protested ."
Captain Clemens' signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting teams .
"`` Reckon ye're right , Dan '' , Hez called back over his shoulder ."
`` I'll shore be needing ye both on the pull out o' the canyon '' .
`` Like enough we'll all be up on top by sundown '' .
"Out of the corner of his eye , he could see his father's wheels beginning to turn ."
"Before Harmony had a chance to reply , Rod cracked his long whip over his thin oxen's backs ."
Men crowded the streets and freight rigs and teams were moving about .
"`` Take one side of the street , and I'll take the other '' , he proposed ."
`` If you spot Carmer give a yell before you move in '' .
"Separating , they took different sides of the main drag and systematically combed the bars ."
Russ visited two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero .
Behind its ornate facade the notorious dive clung like a bird's nest to the rocky ribs of the canyonside .
"Heading for the batwings , Cobb glanced perfunctorily through the nearest window , and suddenly dodged aside ."
"Nerves tight as a bowstring , he paused to gather his wits ."
He fought down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on the spot .
"Reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows , he feverishly scanned the busy street below ."
"Muffling an exclamation , Russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down ."
"As luck had it , he had not gone twenty feet in the street before Pat appeared ."
"`` He's there '' , he got out tersely , curbing his rising excitement ."
"Climbing the steps steadily , they reached the top and headed for the door ."
"Forced behind him momentarily , Russ followed at once and halted two steps inside ."
"Looking the setup over , Stevens started coolly for the rear of the place ."
The bartender measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it .
"A hall opened in back of the bar , running toward an ell ."
"Small rooms , probably for cards , opened off on either side ."
"Pat saw Gyp Carmer staggering forward , a half-filled bottle upraised as if to strike ."
"But he was more than half-drunk , and his faculties were dulled ."
Cobb unleashed a single powerful jab that sent Gyp reeling wildly and crashing down with a whining groan .
Russ gave him a brutal thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach .
"Kneeling , Cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back , holding him pinned ."
If we have to we'll take him apart and see what he's made of '' ! !
"Complying methodically , Pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing ."
"Cobb watched this with hunted eyes , his desperate hope waning by the moment ."
"Straightening up , his eyes ablaze , he held out the battered Stetson ."
"Inside the crown , stuffed behind the stained sweatband , could be seen thin , crumpled wads of currency ."
"You were right '' , Russ exclaimed , tearing the loose bills out of Carmer's hat ."
"`` That is , if we can be sure this is Colcord's money '' --"
Russ ran through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any cowpuncher would come by honestly .
"`` It's within a hundred of what Crip had '' , he declared ."
"Handing the money over , Russ wiped his hands on his pants-legs as if ridding himself of something unclean ."
"Leaving the card room , they moved back through the Palace the way they had come ."
"Glowering looks met them in the bar , but there was no attempt to halt them ."
"Pausing in the outside door to glance behind him , Pat looked his unspoken warning and stepped out ."
"It was you that tracked it down anyway , Stevens '' , he pursued strictly ."
"Pat swung into the saddle , yet still he delayed , his brows puckered ."
Then maybe next time he won't be so quick on the trigger '' .
"`` But I still think Penny's an awful nice girl , Russ '' --"
"Giving the other a dark look , he hauled his bronc around and trotted down off the street ."
"The truth was , the puncher was both bewildered and dismayed by his own mixed luck ."
"`` Penny's always glad to see me over there '' , he mused bleakly ."
"Over and above that , however , was his growing suspicion of Chuck Stober's part in recent events ."
`` It's the second time War Ax hands made a play for that money .
"Nearing home , he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun ."
In town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot ; ;
"Two minutes later it came again -- a double explosion , followed by a third , sounding more distant ."
As near as Cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the Antler ranch house .
"So far as he knew , only his father could be there ."
"Clapping spurs to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter , with growing alarm ."
His first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells told him nothing .
"Still a quarter-mile away , the fresh clap of guns only served to increase his speed ."
"When it was followed by a second , whining even closer , Cobb swerved sharply aside into a depression ."
"A carbine cracked more loudly , and a slug clipped fragments from the brush off at one side ."
"Swinging up then , and bending forward over the horn , he urged his mount down the meandering draw ."
He had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind .
"He had been sighted , and his attacker pumping shot after shot ."
A shot or two went wild before Cobb felt something tug at his foot .
"A second twitched his shirtsleeve , and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm ."
At the first shot Russ had hurled his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw .
"Sweeping a look around , he saw that he was safe for the moment ."
"He heard cries from behind him , but he could make out no words ."
"He dashed madly for the next elbow turn in the draw , and made it ."
"Recklessly hurling the bronc sidewise into an intersecting draw , he plunged forward with undiminished speed ."
Early in November the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions .
Cricket took eight ships and went south across the Straits and along the north coast of Mindanao to Cagayan .
It was a rough long ride through the mud and pot holes .
The truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread through the jungle .
Donovan snatched Greg's chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it .
Greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before .
But his hands and those of Donovan moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the check-out procedure .
"Don't you worry , chief '' , Greg replied , wondering if he himself believed it ."
"See you '' , Donovan said as he jumped off the wing ."
"At the prearranged time , Greg started the engine and taxied out ."
"Yet long before the scheduled time for return , Donovan would be watching for every speck in the sky ."
The dark brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful .
Water splashed against his windshield as he led the flight in and out of showers .
The metal strip they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it .
As far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it .
"`` Roger , Sweeney '' , Todman called back , and pulled his four in and slightly above Greg ."
"If the other pilots were worried , they did not show it ."
He spread the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast .
Although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity .
Once Todman thought he had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while Greg covered him .
Todman said over the radio as he came back up in formation .
"Visibility continued to be limited , and Greg was never able to get above a thousand feet ."
His earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights .
He thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of Fleischman claiming a kill .
There was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run .
Only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle .
"With their load of bombs gone , the planes moved swiftly and easily ."
Greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home .
"Like a man making a deep dive , Greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley ."
"He saw them , specks against the gray , but closing fast ."
His mind flicked through the mental pictures he had from the hours of Aircraft Identification .
He narrowed the shape down to two : either a Zero or a U. S. Navy type aircraft .
"Japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability , American on speed and firepower ."
"His present maximum altitude , up against the overcast , gave him the opportunity to exploit his advantages ."
But the closing aircraft showed no sign of deviating from their original course .
Greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two `` Rogers '' .
"The planes , light with most of the gas burned out , responded beautifully ."
"There was , of course , no way for the other planes to get by them ."
"If any of us miss , they can pick up the pieces ."
"Even as he said it , Greg knew they had found the enemy ."
"The shapes were unmistakable and the Rising Suns were showing up , slightly brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom ."
Greg slapped his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight .
The circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector glass in front of him .
"If the turn was too tight , a barrel roll would bring them out ."
The clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around .
"`` They haven't seen us '' , Greg yelled to himself over the engine noise ."
Just like shooting at a duck while performing a half-gainer from a diving board .
His burst held for a second on the engine section of the plane .
"If he spun out now , he would join his opponent on the ground ."
He pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back .
Sweat popped out over him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip .
"We were coming to an intersection , turning right , chuffing to a stop ."
White-shirted and conservatively-cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze .
"`` Mor-ee-air-teeeee '' , he shrieked , his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of the glittering blonde ."
"Still nursing anger I listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly approaching , its pre-war chrome nearly blinding me ."
"The voice was that of Johnson , tail gunner off another crew ."
"`` Ahm goin nawth t'jawn mah husbun in Sante Fe , an y'all maht prefuh the suhthuhn rewt ."
But Corporal Johnson has alreadeh said it didn make no diffrunce t'hi-im '' .
"I said that it didn't make any difference to me either , as far as I knew ."
"When Johnson ejaculated `` Howsabout my buying us all a nice cold Co-cola , Ma'am '' ? ?"
"`` In back , buddy '' , the driver said to me ."
"Quickly but carefully lowering my duffel bag over the low side-rack , I stepped on the running board ; ;"
I was again in motion and at a speed which belied the truck's similarity to Senor X's Ford turtle .
"White teeth suddenly vanishing , the driver slammed the side of his bottle against Johnson's ear ."
I ducked just as the first strand broke somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards .
"We were in a field , in a tight , screeching turn ."
"When I fell on my back , I saw a vulture hovering ."
"Johnson's left hand was pressed against the side of his head , red cheeks whitening beneath his fingers ."
"`` Tee-wah '' , the driver cackled , his black eyes glittering behind dull silver chicken fencing ."
"You thought I was a Mexican , didn't you , buddy '' ? ?"
No sooner had I started drinking than the driver started zigzagging the truck .
"High , so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car's steel roof ."
"Another car was coming , a tiny , dark shape on a far hill ."
"In the ditch sand was white and soft-looking , only an occasional pebble discernible , faintly gleaming ."
"But Johnson couldn't quickly unwire the truck door , and if I escaped , he might suffer ."
On the truck bed there was nothing smaller than a piece of rusty machinery ; ;
with more time I could have loosened a small burr or cotter pin --
Suddenly and not a second too soon I thought of the coins in my pocket .
"There was a blur just under my focus of vision , a crash ; ;"
the car's far windshield panel turned into a silver web with a dark hole in the center .
"I heard the screech of brakes behind me , an insane burst of laughter beneath me ."
"Two cars came over a crest , their chrome and glass flashing ."
This time there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking of women .
I looked back at pale ovals framed in the elongated oval of the car's rear window .
"I guided her to the divan , turned off the TV , faced her ."
"It was a disturbingly familiar face , too , but I couldn't remember where we had met ."
"I said , `` Do we know each other , Miss '' ? ?"
"She jerked the coat back on and squeezed it around her again , but not soon enough ."
"`` You may have seen me on TV '' , she said ."
"In fact , I was watching you on that little seventeen-inch screen when you rang my bell ."
"Man , you rang -- it was in color , too , Miss , and Miss ? ?"
"I don't mean to pry , but do they hide the swimsuit with the bubbles ? ?"
"`` I really do have something important to tell you , Mr. Scott ."
"Zing was the creation of two men , Louis Thor and Bill Blake , partners in zing ! !"
"`` Did leap into the pool , and didn't have anything on ."
"Maybe Lou was only unconscious , but right then I thought he must be dead ."
"The man shoved him into the water , then ran past the cabana ."
"I was so scared well , I just ran to my car and came here '' ."
"She realized I'd have to notify the police , but fervently hoped I could avoid mentioning her name ."
"As far as I was concerned , she had already and had dandily shown what she could do ."
"But I promised Joyce I would mention her name , if at all , only as a last resort ."
It'll probably be at least an hour or two before I can check back with you .
But suddenly those hot-honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms of bees in them .
I spun about and clattered through the front room to the door .
"As I went out , I could hear water pouring in the shower ."
"But the scene was not the quiet , calm scene I'd expected ."
"Four cars were parked at the curb , and two of them were police radio cars ."
I followed a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool .
Rawlins worked out of Central Homicide and we'd been friends for years .
"Neither of them , I understood , had been present at the filming session earlier ."
The arrangement I had with him was to work four hours a day .
I loved the city and I particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of Mardi Gras .
The very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure .
My Uncle and I were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages .
And that is the way I first saw her when my Uncle brought her into his antique store .
I was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly averted them .
I thought I saw a faint surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks .
"And then I became aware that she , too , glanced at me surreptitiously ."
I felt that her eyes were undressing me as if she were a painter and I a nude model .
"When our eyes met the air was filled with an unuttered message of `` Me , too '' ."
"Perhaps , with my Uncle , she found a measure of economic security that she needed ; ;"
or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father ; ;
I was waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my Uncle's indisposition .
I was aware of a humid look in her eyes that told me the time was opportune .
There was little likelihood of any customers walking in at that hour .
"Her mouth , which had been so much in my thoughts , was warm and moist and tender ."
"I heard her murmur , `` We'd better lock the door '' ."
It did not take me long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and its couch .
When we opened the door again for business and switched on the lights she said :
I've noticed the way you've been looking at me ever since we met '' .
Even as I said it I realized that an education can be invaluable .
`` I don't want to be thrown out and I don't think I will .
I think I have a way so we can carry on without his suspecting us '' .
`` By telling him you are making passes at me '' ? ?
In those days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some corkers to tell ; ;
and now I think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us .
"A lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks , and having a ball ."
We made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake Ponchartrain .
And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead .
He could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask .
When I show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it '' .
I quit work at my usual hour as if this day was no different from other days .
In one hand he gripped firmly a parasol though there had been no indication of rain .
"In the half darkness I approached cautiously , making sure he did not see me ."
-- and you fall for a pass by his own nephew ! !
"`` Squaresville , man , and all the palazzos are crummy Palasts '' ."
"Five days later , on receiving it , Meredith sat drumming his dactyls on his writing table ."
"Meredith's fingers slowed and stopped over a line before him : Sie lacheln , die Schwarzen Hexen ."
"Or , more rhythmically , ' The swarthy witches are laughing ' ? ?"
"Nicolas : `` Look , Nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys -- no sex , see ? ?"
"To this meek conjugation Nicolas had replied , `` O.K. I can use this blanket ."
"And when you get off this job tonight , well , you can gimme something to eat '' ."
"He had always known how to find a bed , and on his own terms ."
") Her Nicolas lay curled in the sun like a fawn , black hair falling over his eyes ."
"This was surely a reunion in art , it was all that poetry promised ."
That long night with Nicolas and marijuana in Venice had opened her eyes .
"Her eyes had opened , she had caught a glimpse of a new faith ."
"Mary Jane might not be the most intelligent woman , but she was one of the most determined ."
"Even so , it took her several days to force Walter to tell her Nicolas's whereabouts ."
She had arrived this morning and come straight to the English Gardens .
"`` His address '' , Walter added , `` is that great foundling home , the American Express ."
And I will greatly appreciate it if you will not tell your husband .
"Smiling , she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched ."
Nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed against the dashboard of a speeding car .
"In his dream he cried , `` Slow down , for Chrissake '' ! !"
He half woke and rolled over with his face in the cooler grass .
"when it stopped he began busily typing , sitting up in a virtuous way ."
Her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight down to her shoulders .
"veal cutlets : `` Oh , I couldn't possibly eat all this '' ! !"
Wine : `` Then you were typing poems this afternoon '' ? ?
Fruit compote : `` If you think I would understand it '' ; ;
Opening these he brought out a schnapps bottle and small gold thimble-sized glasses hidden inside it .
"Steinhager '' She whispered Steinhager to herself , several times , memorizing it ."
"Meredith's voice was always deep , with rough bass notes in it ; ;"
"Mary Jane took the page from him and began reading it , moving her lips with the words ."
"`` Oh , it's that myth , about Orpheus and What is her name ? ?"
"She raised her face and nodded , `` It's sweet , and very sad '' ."
They discussed the way people never tell each other the things on their minds .
"She confessed she was unhappy , he asked was it her husband ? ?"
"At her door , two or three hours later , Mary Jane whispered , `` Everyone is asleep '' ."
suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping ; ;
Ben Prime extended his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxen .
He removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face .
They could no longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat bag that cooled it by evaporation .
He replenished the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck .
"She took it grudgingly , her dark eyes baleful as they met his ."
She drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face .
"She was like charcoal , he thought -- dark , opaque , explosive ."
"A ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws , but he kept control upon his voice ."
He tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river .
"`` We can get it if we dig '' , he said patiently ."
"`` Or do you want to see if I can stand fever , too '' ? ?"
"`` We're lost and burning up already '' , she bit out tensely ."
"`` Hettie '' , he said as gently as he could , `` we're still headed west ."
`` Maybe in time to make a cross and dig our graves '' .
"It had been a mistake , but anything would have been a mistake , as it turned out ."
It wasn't the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her .
The bitterness of their wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound .
She had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder .
"He had left her inviolate , thinking familiarity would gentle her in time ."
"He stared at the dipper , turning it over and over in his wide , calloused hands ."
`` They wouldn't have sold me in the first place if there'd been food enough to go around '' .
"`` Hettie , they didn't sell you '' , he said miserably ."
"Without money or property , what would you have had at Baton Rouge '' ? ?"
"He wanted to turn them , putting the wagon against the storm ."
The clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel .
"The heavens opened , pelting them with hail the size of walnuts ."
Walls of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests of flash floods .
"The jetting , frothing surface of the river reached the level of the runoff ."
"The dangerous current upon the prairie ceased , but the water stood and kept on rising ."
"They cringed under sodden covers , listening to the waves slop against the bottom ."
"They were engulfed by the weird silence , broken only by the low , angry murmur of the river ."
"Then the darkness thinned , and there was light again , and then bright sunlight ."
"Now and then , the glistening side of a half-swamped object showed as it swept past ."
"The girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine , hugging her shoulders and still trembling ."
Her face was pale but set and her dark eyes smoldered with blame for Ben .
"The soaking will put life back in the wagon , too '' ."
"It raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair , sitting astride an upright branch ."
"But as the tree passed , she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell ."
"It speared up into the air , then sinking back , the up-jutting branch turned slowly ."
"Ben's eyes strained with the bitter hurt , his homely face slashed with gray and crimson ."
He let down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water .
He sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of seed grain forward .
He examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished .
"The waters lay muddy but placid , without a ripple of movement against the wheels ; ;"
there was not a match-width of damp mark to show they were receding .
"He doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate , dry hills that rimmed the valley ."
Then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen .
"The spokes were tight again , the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece ."
He got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee .
He found a jar of preserved tomatoes and one of eggs that they had meant to save .
"Now he broke them open , hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing Hettie ."
"He furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins , leaving the ribs and wagon open ."
"He looked thoughtfully at his wife's trunk , holding her meager treasures ."
"He said hesitantly , `` Hettie , I don't figure your things got wet too much ."
"Sulphur , oil , and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams of ."
I suppose a Lascar sailor had sneaked a cigarette in the hold and touched off the blaze .
He sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard into the shark-infested waters .
"Brassnose yelled : `` Come on , Sommers , Max step on it , we got a chance now ."
"We pulled and swore and yanked and wept , scraping our hands until they bled profusely ."
"Brassnose , Max and I leaped into the sea and swam to the boat ."
"`` Let's get away fast '' , said Brassnose , shaking water from his mop of bleached hair ."
"Dimly , we heard the voices of men in mortal agony but we couldn't go back into that inferno ."
"`` Sommers , you bale while we row '' , Brassnose commanded ."
"Three days previously , we had steamed past barren Rennell Island in the distance ."
I'm sure that males have something to do with that process '' ! !
"In fact , one important aspect of their very religion is the annihilation of men '' ."
"`` I think I know what you mean , Brassnose '' , I said ."
"Three hours later , while we were bailing desperately , a dot of land came into view ."
"In a voice so frightened as to seem not his own , the big bo'sun's mate quavered :"
"There was a wooden tower or derrick there , something like a ski jump ; ;"
"It was embarrassing to see strapping , blonde Brassnose comport himself like a child who talks about bogeymen ."
"It is their tultul , the ' jumping platform ' of death ."
They had never seen a tultul but they had heard about it from their fathers '' .
But he had turned a sickly green and appeared tongue-tied or panicked .
My friends and I come from a ship which was destroyed by fire .
The girl in the prow of the outrigger turned a smile like a beacon on me .
"She said , `` My name is Songau and these girls are Ponkob and Piwen ."
All my rosy visions of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished at the sight .
There was a mound of bleached human bones and skulls at the base of the big wooden derrick .
The man must have leaped to his death from the topmost rung of the tultul .
Our old one blew down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu festival fifteen moons ago .
"At first , I thought he was out of his head , talking wildly like this ."
But a glance at Songau and the other women confirmed what Brassnose had blurted out .
The man was an ox and he put up a creditable struggle ; ;
but four Eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived .
My last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face
"For an anthropologist , loquacious old L'Turu was a mine of information ."
"Within a decade or less , few men were left and a feminist society had sprung up ."
The old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood .
"`` I guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized , then headed for home ."
"Maybe he was only doing the best he knew how , like any of us ."
"Anyway , he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at ."
"`` Ever see yourself spread out on the pavement , Benny '' ? ?"
Benson grinned and flipped a rock with his thumb like a marble .
"Ramey smiled but he thought to himself , I always see me too ."
Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think .
"With this realization , sometimes , he saw himself as he looked down ."
"`` Too long a waiting line '' , Ramey answered , pretending to joke ."
Sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed .
"Horsely , an agent on the east end , wore the hat , trying to look like a tourist ."
He chatted with Ramey and Benson for a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer .
"When they were ready to leave , Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer ."
"`` There's a body you won't mind looking at '' , Benson said and they stopped ."
"Slender and tanned , her dark brown hair was drawn straight back , simply ."
"Benson said , and Ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been ."
Her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing .
The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her .
The man stood near the bent levi-clad body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car .
With Ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was half-off the Indian's foot that he would always remember .
"The slightest twitch would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot , yet the toes were still inside ."
"He turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes , immaculate eyes ."
He was very tanned -- big hands might have torn him from a Coca-Cola poster .
"It was simply a matter of curiosity , a natural right to examine ."
"The man said , backing up a step , still looking down ."
Ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin .
Ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth .
he laid all four knuckles in between the man's cheekbone and his chin .
The man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement .
Ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand .
He hadn't done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard .
"With a thoughtful look , the man sat on the pavement , legs straight out in front of him ."
"His arms hung like empty shirt sleeves , and his mouth was slightly open ."
"After what seemed several seconds , the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it ."
The man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he touched his mouth .
"A woman's voice said , and then he heard a sort of wail from the man's wife ."
one of his hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him .
The girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back .
"`` Can you hear , can you talk to me '' ? ?"
`` Why did you do it -- why did you hit him '' ? ?
A shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again .
"Benson moved his arms , gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly ."
Some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey .
Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer .
He walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him .
"`` Mough -- it's my mough '' , the man said , trying to talk without moving his lips ."
"He slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up , alarmed at the sound of the shots ."
"`` Keith '' , said Penny , `` Keith , you were wonderful ."
"I don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life , but I am ."
"And for the hundredth time that week , he was startled at her beauty ."
"`` I realize that this is hardly the time to say it , Penny '' , said Keith ."
"`` Yes '' , she said , almost in a whisper , as if admitting to a crime ."
"Now , she just sat there looking at him , without an expression except concern for him ."
`` All of us -- every goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle .
"You hate me , you hate my guts , because I like to hunt ."
You actually hate me -- and we both know it -- because I killed that filthy snake .
"`` There isn't anything left to say , is there , Keith '' ? ?"
"He knew she was not sulking , not even angry at him ."
But `` after the war '' was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself .
He became a fighter pilot after the stint over the Hump in the big crates .
"The other half he didn't like to recognize , even to himself ."
"Not defending England , or being an ace , or fighting for humanity ."
And he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a Nazi .
"Nowadays , we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish ."
"The Nazis bombed Britain , so the RAF retaliated and shot them all down ."
"Keith learned too much about air combat , and air killing , to be risked ."
"He had a war reputation , but this was the kind of man women like even without medals ."
"He had strength in his six-foot frame , but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier ."
But they met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly .
"The bomb plunged into the ground near the Post , but not precisely into the Command room itself ."
"They stood there , just the two of them , in the rocking , shattering blast ."
Keith's eyes met Penny's as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction .
"After the war , Penny had wanted Keith at least to visit her home with her ."
"It wasn't that , however , which decided them not to go to America ."
Keith told Penny about his dream to return to India and Burma .
"He stressed the wild beauty of the mountains , and the jungles ."
He didn't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself .
"And in the hunting land , this hunger was considered to be a noble thing ."
"When they got to Shillong , in Assam , he was happy ."
"This was the land of the sladang , the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread ."
"The sambur buck , the jungle stag that is even more noble than the Scottish elk ."
"He even hunted elephant , although the Asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his African cousin ."
"He and Penny would go out on tame elephants , raised from babyhood in the keddah ."
"There were fantastic flowers without perfume , and gaudy birds without song ."
"Mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants , or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close ."
"He and his safety man , Herr Schaffner , swam up to the boarding ladder together ."
"Robinson clambered heavily into the boat , sat down , and stripped off his triple-tank assembly ."
"He took his mask from his forehead and threw it , unexpectedly , across the deck ."
"`` Temper , temper '' , Mrs. Forsythe said , laughing uneasily ."
"`` I loused it '' , Rob said , with a savage note in his voice ."
`` All I have to do to set the record is to go on down .
"`` The equipment was fine '' , Rob stated , standing up ."
I don't get it why this time I should pull such a stupid trick '' .
"`` Well , I get it '' , Artie said , still on the ladder ."
`` You are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting a record .
"`` When I came up , damnit , I thought I was going down ."
I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening '' .
`` Rob's not going to give up as easy as all that '' .
I've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brother's tackle shop .
He went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters ; ;
"`` When you gotta go , you gotta go '' , Mrs. Forsythe said ."
Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge .
"`` No thank you very much '' , Schaffner had answered in his accented English ."
"Waddell had looked the man over , trying to size him up ."
`` Rob tells me he's using your Atlantis equipment on the dive '' .
"`` Please let me explain '' , the German said earnestly , his face still devoid of deceit ."
`` I have in Europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year .
"Now I wish to enter the American market , where the competition is very strong ."
"With all respect to a fine young man , Mr. Roy is not able to provide these necessaries '' ."
"Waddell was not an eminently moral person , but he did not like what he had just heard ."
"`` Perhaps not in so many words '' , the German said ."
"There was the end of his front-page feature story , with byline ."
"`` If you will pardon , I think it would be better if not ."
"`` Well , let's let him make up his own mind , OK '' ? ?"
"`` You will make him unhappy and anxious '' , the German said ."
"It is not good , Mr. Waddell : you will do him great harm '' ."
There was no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said .
"`` I am an honest man '' , the German said with fervor ."
I will make him distributor for all of Florida -- a big market .
This will help him to get out of his little tackle shop .
But there is no use causing him to worry at this time '' .
The German's words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty .
It would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this .
"`` I think maybe you're right , Schaffner '' , he said ."
"`` He has the distributorship for Florida , you say '' ? ?"
He sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps .
"Now , in that same cabin , Robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk ."
And when I make the dive again '' -- He paused ; ;
"Folding between his hands the cross that hung from his neck , he took his appeal direct to Headquarters ."
Artie had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger .
"You don't see me stretched out on the deck , do you '' ? ?"
"As his feet slowed , he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand ."
He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed .
For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time .
His superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure .
His remembering the self-dictate brought no peace -- only a faint chill of doubt .
"He murmured to himself , with firmness : `` No surrender '' ."
"His superiors had also preached this , saying it was the way for eternal honor ."
"The knife , an ammunition pouch , and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt ."
His fatigues made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist .
"`` Come out , come out in the meadow '' , Matsuo said under his breath ."
The man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face .
"Matsuo lifted his rifle , easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness ."
Fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills .
"They had fought from caves , and the marines resorted to burning them out ."
"When he sank on his knees , they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy ."
"The callous marines had laughed at each other's retching , while stacking bodies ."
"At nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle , reeking of death ."
"Apprehensively he peered to the left , to the right into the leafy , vine-crisscrossed maze ."
"He decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow , with the one left to distract him ."
Only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird .
"Because he couldn't hear them , he was more convinced they were there ."
A spectacle occurred across the meadow : the lone marine took a seat on the ground ; ;
"While his comrades cocked the trap , that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver ."
"He wanted the arrogant marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head ."
"Like a mischievous boy expecting punishment , Matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle ."
"Before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy , and insects hummed and birds occasionally called ."
"He went into a whirling dance , a sort of blind chasing of the tail ."
"He wore no head cover of any kind and , more odd , had no visible weapon ."
"With a sudden decisiveness he lurched in Matsuo's direction , crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop ."
"When he got closer to the tree , Matsuo noted the wild look on his face ."
"The bobbing head was a poor target , so Matsuo shot him in the upper trunk ."
"The marine spun , clapping a hand high on his chest , and dived forward ."
Down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage .
"The marine was sprawled some thirty yards away , one arm extended ."
"Heat , in the sunlight , pressed in like an invisible crowd ."
"He squatted by the head , gently placing the rifle on the ground ."
The bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone ; ;
"Maintaining his clutch on the hair , Matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets ."
"In one : a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter , both sticky from the man's bleeding ."
In the other : a wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief .
He didn't smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter ; ;
"he had no use any longer for exact time , even had the watch been running ."
Then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief .
The cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure .
"The marine's eyes opened , squeezed shut , then opened squinted in the glare ."
"Not only had he no canteen , but he lacked even the belt to hang one on ."
"Drunk on sake , he must have wandered off from his bivouac ."
"The marine tried to roll on his right side , and moaned ."
Awkwardly with one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle .
"In the caves , with other supplies , they had kept cases of sake ."
The sun was noon high and Matsuo perspired until his body was dripping .
Wet also were the marine's fatigues and the face had an oily film .
"Even the bone handle scorched , and he retrieved the marine's handkerchief to wrap it ."
First he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes .
With a firm grip on the man's hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek .
"A shrill yelp , kicked legs , and groping hands that circled Matsuo's wrist ."
The marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment .
"He dropped the knife in its scabbard , hung the rifle behind a shoulder ."
"The marine , hands on cheeks , rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach ."
"In the jungle , birds were mute , while insects preserved only the monotony of living ."
"It was the marine : head lifted , he strained and called ."
Then he astonished Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat .
Once and for all he'd finish this marine who would not die .
"It sounded as if the man were calling him : `` Hey , Japanese hey there , Japanese '' ."
The man tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container .
"He performed the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct ."
The marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol .
His years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline .
"He began to uncap the bottle , the rusty cap squealing on its threads ."
down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out .
The marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack .
"After all , he had less reason to desire it than the marine ."
"`` Your superiors will certainly beat you for your desertion , besides the dishonor of it ."
From the convulsive quivers of the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping .
He reminded Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China .
"Blue Throat was slumped with his back against the bar , elbows supporting his massive frame ."
"`` Since when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys '' ? ?"
`` Seems to me I don't remember altering any law about that '' .
"He straightened up , alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer ."
"`` Stay right here where you are , kid '' , he called ."
`` I don't aim to have minors breathing down my neck when I'm a-drinking '' :
"`` I'm Billy Tilghman '' , said the stranger , `` and I've come for Pat Conyers' body '' ."
"`` And what makes you think you're going to get it , pretty boy '' ? ?"
"His gun was half drawn when he asked the question , but the weapon never left its holster ."
"His head snapped round and he reeled back , crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling ."
A bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from Tilghman's stomach as Blue Throat's henchmen started shooting .
"Tilghman flung himself aside , dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun ."
"`` Yes , George , but I ain't got poor old Pat's body yet ."
"He fired again , and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed ."
Another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor .
"Tilghman and his partner , George Rust , herded the men into a corner ."
"`` And now '' , said Tilghman with deadly calm , `` I'll repeat what I said ."
The entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn .
"The law-abiding citizens of Petrie had gathered inside Kaster's Store , halfway down the street ."
He called the store owner and together they went into the stockroom .
"He slipped outside , hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways ."
Fifty yards away from the barn he dodged inside a barber's shop and came out at the back .
"Within seconds the big barn was blasted into smoking splinters , with every outlaw either dead or injured inside ."
Though only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts .
He was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gun-slinging character in the book .
It was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside .
"The only evidence of occupation came from the chimney , which was belching out thick smoke ."
The two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door .
"Leaving his rifle in the wagon , Tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it ."
There was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside .
"Directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire , a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day ."
"Seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher , Ed Dunn ."
"Along each side of the room were six tiered bunks , each one screened off with a curtain ."
"And projecting wickedly through these curtains were the gleaming muzzles of six rifles , all trained on Billy Tilghman ."
He walked right up to the fire as though blissfully unaware of the guns covering him .
The men behind them were Bill Doolin and five of his gang -- every man a killer .
"`` Follow the river for five miles '' , he said hoarsely ."
All that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body .
One false move on his part and he would be a dead man .
"He strolled back to the door , whistling softly , hands still clasped behind him ."
`` Just get out of here without it looking as though we're in a hurry .
Even as he spoke those words Billy Tilghman's life hung on a thread .
"`` You'll stay right here '' , commanded Bill Doolin , covering Red with his rifle ."
`` Billy Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back .
"Sometimes he did this three or four times a day , for this Woman was almost always with him ."
"But they never said anything , so he figured it was all right ."
He could not keep his eyes off her when at school ; ;
Miss Langford ( her first name was Evelyn ) was an attractive girl .
"He jumped back , ducked and ran , crouching , down the hill away from the school ."
"He ate litle that morning , and his mother became concerned , inasmuch as he usually ate heartily ."
"She said , with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child ."
"`` No , I'm not hungry '' , he said , pushing back the bacon and eggs ."
"And if you get sick , ask the teacher to let you come home early ."
"Daddy left the car for me , and I'm going to town this afternoon '' ."
He considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him .
`` I got Margaret Rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry '' .
"`` No , I mean how'd you get her to do it '' ? ?"
"She's been hangin' around me a lot here lately , and I figgered I might as well's try it ."
Besides I heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin' it '' .
"`` I might try it one of these days '' , Jack said wonderingly , thinking of Miss Langford ."
"`` Time for books '' , she yelled , jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand ."
"`` I'd druther stay here and watch the girls '' , Charles grinned ."
`` Maybe some of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress '' .
"`` Maybe '' , Jack said idly , watching for Miss Langford ."
"`` O.K. '' Charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls ."
With one hand she held her skirt down while she took Jack's extended hand with the other .
He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go .
"`` Will you play with us again , Miss Langford '' ? ?"
"When he came back to the schoolhouse , his mind was made up ."
He simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class .
"`` But I've got to take a chance on it '' , he told himself desperately ."
`` You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems '' .
On the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise .
The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman .
Col. Henri Garvier was one of New Orleans' most important and enlightened slave owners .
Johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones against the gourd which served as his drum .
She was a top horsewoman and one of the city's most gracious hostesses .
"The slender , handsome fellow was called Dandy Brandon by the other slaves ."
He was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race .
But Dandy had had little experience with girls on his master's plantation in Bayou St. John .
This young slave was therefore quite unprepared when Delphine Lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near .
He gaped at Madame Lalaurie and sniffed the Paris perfume which emanated from her .
"She said with intense feeling : `` Come near , let me feel your arms ."
"Lifting her skirts , she climbed in , never relinquishing her grip on his arm ."
The woman seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor .
"This was the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling , shaggy eyebrows ."
I want you to find Monsieur Prieur at once and give him this money for the boy's purchase .
"Dandy , curiosity overcoming his apprehensions , peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle ."
He saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head .
"Really , you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself '' , he said , frowning with displeasure ."
"Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss , and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster ."
He deserves a better life than just rotting away on the Prieur plantation '' .
The physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave .
"Besides , her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth ."
"When he finally left the sinister mansion on Perdido Street , he was carried out in a coroner's basket ."
The lad's once superb body was a mass of scars and welts .
Feebly he pointed an accusing finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted : `` Evil woman ! !
You did this you like to hurt to beat people I want to go home '' .
Dr. Louis Lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead .
"Delphine stood like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse ."
`` I saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square festivities and felt sorry for him .
"How he returned in such a ghastly condition , or why , I cannot say ."
Ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die .
"Moreover , runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans' dives ."
"Once again life went its serene way -- soirees , fox hunts , balls and dinners ."
the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down Perdido Street .
"The fugitive cried out in an oddly sibilant voice : `` Help me , somebody ! !"
They have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw ! !
"`` The accommodations may not be the poshest , but man ! !"
"He had been conning the freights for a long , long time now ."
"Ever since the hooch , and the trouble with the Quartet , and Midge and the child ."
It had been a very long time that had no form and no end .
"The train slowed at a road crossing , and the big door slid open ; ;"
"at first gratingly , caught by grains of corn -- then with a clash into its slot ."
The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor .
"A little thing , but the right twist for the action that counted ."
"Hair like a morning-frightened sparrow's wings , with the sun shining down over them ."
"Then the boy straight-armed himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting ."
"`` Yeah , seems so , don't it '' , the boy laughed , hugging her close ."
"Feathertop interrupted , standing up , brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants ."
"They whirled and saw him , standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall ."
"He was big , and filthy , and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes ."
"`` Come sit '' , said Feathertop , motioning them toward him ."
"`` Now stay with me , Kitty '' , he snapped irritably ."
`` I vowed to take care of you -- and that's what I'm gonna do .
"`` Oooo , square bit '' , Feathertop screwed his face up ."
"They couldn't have much dough , but then none of the freight-bums Feathertop rolled had much ."
"And besides , the chick had a little something the others didn't have ."
"`` Come sit '' , he repeated , motioning to the piled hay bags , over the pig leavings ."
"`` I'm just a poor ex-jazz man , name of -- uh -- Boyd Smith '' ."
"`` That ain't your name , Mister '' , the boy accused ."
"`` Oh , come on , Cappy '' , the girl chided ."
"She started to move toward the hay bags , dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her ."
"it had been a long , hot while since he'd seen anything as nice as this within grabbin' distance ."
"`` Where'd you come from , Mr. -- uh -- Mr. Smith '' ? ?"
"`` What's the matter , she wanna go the bathroom '' ? ?"
"Certainly not , I mean , no that isn't what I said '' ! !"
"`` A charcoal pit , man '' , he said , indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier ."
"`` Fan it '' , he told Cappy , handing him a sheet of newspaper ."
He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners .
"Not the greatest , but they stick to your belly insides '' ."
"He ripped down the cellophane carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil ."
"`` How come you're riding the rods , kids like you '' ? ?"
"Cappy looked down at his wide hands , and did not reply ."
"But surprisingly , Kitty's face came up and she said , `` My father ."
"After a few seconds , she said , `` Dad didn't like Cappy ."
If I'd been careful it never woulda '' -- he stopped abruptly .
"The girl still did not raise her eyes , but she added simply , `` I'm pregnant '' ."
"But that had been a time before all this , a time he didn't think about ."
A time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out .
"Ernie offered , taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket ."
"Real big , with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a grizzly ."
"The big man asked again , taking a step into the boxcar ."
"`` Sure '' , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips ."
He guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder .
"The man stalked toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring ."
"He threw his head back , closed his eyes , and belched ferociously ."
"He belched again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door ."
"`` Well , now '' , he said , and reached into his pocket ."
`` I didn't know I was gonna have company in this car '' .
"He had suspected this guy was trouble , and now he was sure of it ."
"`` Maybe you and me will , girlie , but these two ain't goin' nowhere '' ."
"He advanced on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car ."
"The newcomer stalked toward them , and Kitty shied back , her hand to her mouth ."
"The kid showed for an instant , and his arm was cocked back ."
He held the knife aloft an instant -- an instant enough to press the stud .
"He fisted the knife overhand , and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat ."
"She grabbed at Feathertop's sleeve and shrieked , `` Help him ! !"
"Filippo Rossi , that's what he was called in the old country ; ;"
The only thing unusual about the Old Man had long since happened .
In one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase .
"`` But she shouldn't have come here in the first place '' , the women had said ."
She thought she was bigger than we are because she came from Torino '' .
`` It's not for making pretty speeches about Dante those actresses get paid so good '' .
"But if the Old Man even thought about his wife now , nobody cared a fig ."
The women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell ; ;
but he might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto him .
) And his eyes -- those miniature sundials of variegated yellow -- had not altered their expression or direction .
It could have been Bari or Chieti for the way it smelled .
Or that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the Schuylkill ? ?
"This place was hatred to him , just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness ."
It slashed the sloping manure-scented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches .
It swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors .
"Even the stable-garage , which housed nothing now but the scent of rot , had a lawn before it ."
It squatted low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade .
"Above it , from a second-story showroom , wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood ."
"Love and hatred and fear were one here , shaded only by fig trees and grape vines ."
And the forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch .
"Waiting for what and for whom , only he could tell and would not ."
To him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep .
"When he would be a man , he would be a rich man ."
He would not ride the eight-thirty local to the city each morning .
He would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step .
"`` Laura , what would you say if I smoked a pipe '' ? ?"
"One lithe leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking , torn pales ."
"All the while she sat there , her sinewy arms swirled before her chest ."
"The eyes , blue and always somewhat downcast , possessed a sullen quality ."
"Even though the boy could not see them , he knew they were clouded by distance ."
"Well , what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about ? ?"
"And as for his pipe , if he wanted to smoke one , nobody would stop him ."
"The Old Man near the corner let the shadow pass over him , sensing something portentous in it ."
"There would be time enough , perhaps the Old Man reassured himself , to pay the devil his due ."
Pompeii expected Romeo's small body to sink closer and closer to the ground .
People came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it .
She was so heavy that Maggie's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her .
there was the daily round of household chores in which Maggie insisted on participating .
"`` It seems to me you have enough to do as it is '' , Eugenia said ."
She had been watching Maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again .
"`` I have plenty of odd moments when I could be doing something '' , Maggie said ."
"`` She's so beautiful , and I do like to keep her looking nice '' ."
She picked up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck .
"`` She'll be just as beautiful in something that doesn't have to be ironed '' , Eugenia said ."
"`` Well now , Maggie , you don't have to snap at me '' , Eugenia said ."
`` I'm just thinking of a way for you to be sensible '' .
`` You might set up a dress shop in the living room '' .
"`` Oh , I'm sure I could do that '' , Maggie said ."
"`` But it really wouldn't be fair , taking your jobs away from you '' ."
And I can go back to my contests and be thinking while I'm doing the washing '' .
`` What are you going to do with your feet so you don't waste anything '' ? ?
"It grew bitterly cold toward the end of November , contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people ."
The temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days .
and now the East was creating government agencies for which the West doubtless would have to pay .
The government offices were being opened but they weren't being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold penetrated everything .
The Abernathys said it to each other a dozen times a day .
"`` I know you when you start talking about brains and talent '' , Maggie said ."
"`` The only thing that worries me is how I'm going to prove it '' , Eugenia said ."
"`` It was plain as the nose on your face that they're laughing about it , Mamma ."
"`` Let me stay and take the pictures you wanted , Mamma ."
"Wait for me , Laban , I'll be dressed in half a second '' ! !"
"Frank followed her into the bedroom , hooked her dress up the back ."
They're not going to laugh at the Fairbrothers and Labans very long ! !
You know it and I'll tell everybody exactly how it happened '' .
Returning to the log-house he found some favorite lines from Jonathan Swift on his lips :
"If he died before she did , she would never be unable to resist opening it ."
It was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing .
"Beyond his window were the greening trees , new spring , eternal hope , eternal life ."
He poured his thimble of wine for the toast he'd made so often .
But this last time he drank not to Brace but `` To Tolley '' ! !
"He could put a stop to it , she told him again and again ."
"Simply call Mr. Whipsnade Oscar , and Dr. Dunne P.GA , and C'un Major Frank ."
And if I ever hear you say ' Mist Laban ' again I'll scream .
"But Mr. Robards' now , oh my yes , indeed , yes ! !"
"`` Stand back , Miss Jen , she's oneasy of your scarf '' ."
"Tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick , he suggested ."
"The chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came , she was sure ."
"He would be in the barn , or riding for the veterinarian ! !"
"Edmonia for her mother , she said firmly , Jennifer , for herself , and --"
"`` She was mighty good to you past times , an' this'll fetch her '' ."
"Strong too , up on his legs when he was an hour old ."
"Oh , she'd come to see them once , left silver teething rings for all of the trips ."
If he ever did such a thing again she'd die of shame .
"`` Have a party an' leave 'em out , hon '' , he suggested ."
We'll have oystchers -- couple bar'l oystchers'll fetch in a crowd any time .
"He was downright worried about her , but there was one more thing he could try ."
"`` Them's the purtiest babes you ever did see , but Miss Jen gets mighty lonesome ."
"`` He must have forgiven me '' , Henrietta murmured to the room ."
The absolution of Doaty's last will and testament was proof enough of that ; ;
"Henrietta thought , It's extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us ."
"There had been more to know about Hetty , inevitably , and most of it unfavorable ."
"Adelia was the good one , or , if not always good , less frequently tempted ."
"Their childhood would have been quite circumspect without Hetty's flair for drama , especially through the long summers ."
"Mama had died before the corruption of the family circle , the interruption of Charles ."
one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her .
She had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice .
Perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice .
"Before anything else , she would go to Doaty's grave with flowers from Doaty's forgotten garden ."
"Everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards ."
"She closed her eyes , remembering the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls ."
"It had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray ."
The garden below was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness .
"Feeling suddenly neat and subdued , she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs ."
"Rosa , unbelievably , was not yet up and about , reassurance that Rosa was human ."
"The poodle came gleefully to Henrietta and begged for the flowers , supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws ."
Henrietta held her bouquet out of reach and said it was for Doaty .
"The cemetery slumbered just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea ."
"She smiled and bowed , recalling the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child ."
"Now , some of the acknowledgments were cautious , but all were interested ."
"He then offered his own estimate of the weather , which was unenthusiastic ."
"`` I'm taking them to the cemetery '' , said Henrietta , out of a vague feeling of hospitality ."
"`` They'll be takin' me next '' , he said pleasantly , `` but not so soon's they plan ."
See half of 'em in their graves before I choose my own coffin .
"`` Rests the tissues '' , he said , `` and pacifies the system ."
"My dad did it , and he lived to a great age '' ."
"`` Can't blame a man for leavin' his wife '' , he said quite cheerfully ."
"`` Left mine many a time , only she never knew it ."
"Only , this old man's connivance was even less to her taste than Selma Cotter's open censure ."
"Well , she had not come back to Great Island to be understood , praised or condemned ."
"He beat the air with his stick , and it fell from his claws and clattered on the stones ."
"`` He's lowly today '' , his grand-daughter said wearily , and bent to pick it up ."
"The children are eating , and Miss Blackwell's on her way somewheres '' ."
"A small , rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb , the only angel in the cemetery ."
"all their men were bearded , and many of their women were beautiful ."
"Her mouth , soft and full , was something for any man to dream about ."
"She had black eyes , long and intriguingly tilted , and the way she walked was melody ."
"It was an alien land , and she hated it intensely ; ;"
"Tommy was interested in psychiatry , because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients ."
This was one of the Navy's crossroads -- you find them all around the world .
"Sooner or later , all the gray Navy ships came in here ; ;"
And she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back there .
"She felt , rather than saw , the approach of the good-looking young man ."
"Then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke , and it was no different ."
"The nice-looking young officer fell back on his heels , open-mouthed and blushing ."
"At least , he had the decency to blush , she thought ."
"You see , I thought -- I mean I really had no idea '' --"
"Then she jerked her thumb toward the door in a very American gesture , and dropped into Navy slang ."
"He muttered , and took off , obviously feeling like a fool ."
The trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for Tommy .
"It hadn't been this way in college , or in nurses' training ; ;"
Everybody had accepted her for what she was -- a very charming girl .
"Everybody but Tommy seemed to think it was charming when they called , `` Bifutek-san '' ! !"
"Two other Japanese girls were sitting at the tables , both quite pretty and well groomed ."
the other was with her American husband and their exceptionally appealing children .
"She told herself rebelliously , and with pride , I am an American ! !"
There was more to service in the Navy Nurse Corps than the hours in the ward .
"One had to have friends , and a congenial life in after-duty hours ."
She finished her hamburger and drank her coffee and paid her check ; ;
she got out of the coffee shop before the incident could be repeated .
"Back in her living quarters at the hospital she took bicarbonate of soda , and sulked ."
"She certainly looked Japanese , and perhaps she could not really blame the young men ."
"And , still , they did not have to be so crude in their approach ."
"There was a letter to write to her mother , and she tried to make its tone cheerful ."
"Actually , this is only another way of saying that blood is thicker than water ."
Just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive officer didn't know .
There had never been a good reason for Doc Doolittle to grow up .
"He had come into the Navy too young , with the image of the fun-loving Guns Appleby before him ."
"He remained young at heart , with an overdeveloped sense of humor ."
"He was doing thirty years , and the Navy would take care of him ."
"Actually , all a man in uniform has to do is to get by ."
"He may not rise to the heights , but he can get by , and eventually be retired ."
Doc had been under restriction to the ship since the Bustard left Subic .
"This gave Doc the whole range of the naval establishment , and suited him quite well ."
A telephone line had been hooked up to connect the ship with the Base exchange .
"After supper , Doc called Whitey Gresham , who was now a lieutenant and had a family ."
"`` I'll be there , but I'll walk '' , Doc said ."
"How , he wondered , does one enjoy one's spare time ? ?"
He considered some interesting excursion but he was on the road every day from dawn to dusk .
"Perhaps golf , with a fashionable companion -- but he'd lost his clubs , hadn't played in years ."
"Perhaps a packing trip into the Sierras , let his beard grow -- but that was too stark ."
"I could , he thought , take a long walk -- but where ? ?"
"Strippers , but scrumptious , and Toodle Williams and her all-lesbian band '' ."
`` I went over to the Willows and dropped two notes '' .
"When Owen was finally rid of him , there was a timid rap at the door ."
"He was disappointed to find a nervous , scrawny woman with a big hat standing at the door ."
We call them lay-sisters and they go among the Eskimos making friends and bringing the light .
They're up there in that freezing climate and all of us have to try and help them '' .
There was a slight nervous twitch in the region of her left eye .
`` Have you ever tried to reason with an Eskimo '' ? ?
People don't know how much they give away about themselves by remarks like that .
"That she was out for a touch was certain , but when did she get to the pitch ? ?"
"Do you know these women go all through Alaska , and they don't have the proper facilities ? ?"
They travel in pairs as much as a hundred-and-fifty miles a day '' .
`` Do you have any idea how far I travel every day ? ?
Owen was aware he was getting overexcited but he couldn't help himself .
"`` And whiskey '' , she said , smiling and blinking at the highball glasses ."
"She looked crestfallen , as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race ."
"She stood indecisively for a moment , then walked down the hall ; ;"
"He showered , shaved , dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast ."
On the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail .
"There was a check from his company , and the usual enthusiastic bulletins on new lines they always issued ."
"He looked off to the crest of the Sierras , still white-topped ; ;"
"Although it was only three o'clock , he stopped in at the Golden Calf ."
"The tables were all spinning , the dice rattling , the bar crowded ."
"when the management brought around champagne , the breakfast settled its whirling around in his stomach ."
"There were more women than men in the place , but he couldn't find a flowerpot ."
"All , of course , except the Donner party who were bent on starving to death ."
"`` I wonder if they did eat each other at the end '' , Owen mused ."
"He sat down next to a heavily-upholstered blonde , but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes ."
Owen was surprised to see Mrs. Gertrude Parker playing the one-arm bandits that were cunningly arranged by the entrance .
A dried-up cowboy sat down next to him in the blonde's place .
He was a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables .
"`` What you need is a steady martingale '' , the cowboy announced after watching Owen play ."
"Incidentally , I'm pretty famous in these parts : I'm called The Wrangler '' ."
Don't you have to spend any time on your ranch '' ? ?
"He's my own horse , and what I collect from him I use on blackjack ."
This Sparky can rack and single-foot and he's the fastest thing in Washoe County .
"I once trained a horse for Hoot Gibson , but nothing like Sparky ."
"When he looked in the back , Mrs. Gertrude Parker was marking keno cards ."
he studied the pistol exhibition that Hurrays featured as an added attraction .
"He wondered if he might bag a tourist , but they looked frightened of him ."
"He passed two brides , both wearing orchids , and they made him feel a little sad ."
Buzz had on a Hawaiian shirt and was carrying some sun-tan oil and dark glasses .
"He was shorter and fatter than Owen , who felt good standing next to him ."
`` We ran into a guy at the Pagan Room who guarantees we can beat the wheel .
"He started out as a stickman , then became a pit boss until the Club found him crossroading ."
`` I haven't had any luck since I was a baby '' .
"`` Stake me '' , she said , `` and let me at those dice ."
"`` My name's Gisele '' , the blonde said after she ordered a Scotch ."
"My mother wanted to call me Sylphide , but it sounded too affected '' ."
`` Is there any word you would like to offer in your own defense '' ? ?
"Naval procedure , he thought , had its moments of grim humor ."
"In your opinion , who is this E. Andrews on the ' certain ' list '' ? ?"
"He saw the dangers , not the glories of being identified as a mutineer ."
An African knife and battle-ax are at this moment being sharpened by McKinley and Green .
McKinley was overheard to say that he would like to get the knife into Spencer's possession and that '' --
Who reported to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who '' --
A glance revealed that the main topgallant mast had been carried away .
"The aimless milling about of what had been a well-trained , well-organized crew struck Alexander with horror ."
`` Small violently jerked the weather-royal brace with full intention to carry away the mast .
I saw him myself and it was done after consultation with Cromwell .
"Then , with disappointment evident upon their faces , they moved to the work ."
"In the tiny cabin , Alexander met with Gansevoort , Heiser and Wales to speak and to listen ."
"Three days had passed since Spencer's arrest and each day had brought new dangers , new fears ."
To have the Greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed .
"`` Well '' , Heiser ventured , `` why don't we hold an investigation with questioning and '' --"
"`` That would be worse than useless '' , Alexander broke in ."
`` There is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners .
"Besides , suppose we hold a court of inquiry , then what ? ?"
"Mr. Heiser , does this sound like a truly workable plan to you ? ?"
Do you not think these men might choose the black flag here and now '' ? ?
They are about to do so at any moment as it is .
All that is needed is for one man to feel self-confident enough to take the lead .
"We are not going to be rushed and murdered '' , Alexander said ."
`` We are going to bring the Somers into New York harbor safe and sound '' .
"He paused , then added , `` Everything on a ship is a weapon ."
Implements of wood and iron are available for close and hasty combat no matter where a man stands .
And we are positive of so few and suspicious of so many '' .
"He who had tried so hard , who had yearned so passionately to be a great officer ."
"One did one's best and if fortune smiled , there was a reward ."
"And Alexander sobbed like a girl for the dreams he had had , and he felt no shame ."
To have someday that love returned was what he had lived for .
"Yes , he would bring the Somers safely into New York harbor but at a price ."
The prisoners averted their eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger .
"He said , `` Captain , may I speak , please ? ?"
"Captain , I am innocent of any plot against you or the ship '' ."
"I know nothing of any plot , if there is such a thing '' ."
`` You are the only man aboard who can be in doubt '' .
"`` I cannot speak for others , sir , but I am innocent '' ."
"He leaned closer to Alexander , squinting up at him from the deck ."
"`` Surely , Captain , you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything '' ."
"Now Spencer , seeming with effort to shake himself from lethargy , spoke ."
"And in a sudden wave of painful clarity , Alexander recognized a kinship with Spencer ."
Here was another human who understood the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable .
He expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune .
"But he could not have done so , could not have found the way , had fortune favored him ."
"And because fortune had favored neither the prisoner nor the red-haired captain , they would be each other's undoing ."
`` And do you think there is a reason why I should accept your word '' ? ?
"`` That's true '' , Spencer agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation ."
"`` I thought '' , Midshipman Rogers had told Alexander , `` that Spencer was teaching him geometry '' ."
Rachel steered me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the Torah .
A young man appeared out of a side alley and walked toward us with quick strides .
"He wore a long double-breasted coat of a heavy material , dark trousers , and black boots with buckles ."
"His black hat with its wide brim , high crown , and fur trim rode high ."
The girls in the market place wore long-sleeved dresses and covered their legs with cloth stockings .
I turned and watched him stride down the center of the road .
`` When your mother was here he must have been a young boy .
I swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside Rachel .
"The dirty , discolored buildings looked boarded up , and their few windows stood high above our heads ."
"He nodded , clasping and unclasping his hands over his paunch , and flicked glances at me ."
"Little boys crowded together on long wooden benches , and in the center of the room sat the teacher ."
They chanted a fixed tune in time to the report of the stick .
They bent over yellowed prayerbooks and looked up only to watch the teacher .
"Since they did not glance curiously at us once , I guessed that there was a penalty for distraction ."
"The teacher plunged the children into a new portion , this time in Hebrew , rapping the stick incessantly ."
One boy who rocked back and forth over his worn book had bright red hair and freckles .
In the center of his brilliant curls sat a small black skullcap .
Some of them ignored the texts and had apparently memorized the words long ago .
I could not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair .
"Rachel followed , looked at me , and clucked with her tongue ."
"I said , `` How long do they keep that up '' ? ?"
"`` Except for Shabbat , when they are praying all day '' ."
The old man in the baggy clothes waited at the foot of the steps .
"I reached into the pocket of my skirt , fingered ten pruta , and dropped the coin ."
Then I picked it up again and handed it to the old man .
They said that we must not fight but wait for the Messiah '' .
"You had to know , also , that you were going to fail ."
"All of it might have been heroic , but they had done it in the wrong place ."
"She said , `` Sometimes I think they are keeping religion for us while we play around ."
"I said quietly , respectfully , `` What did she do here ? ?"
And I think she sought out danger as much as she sought out helping other people .
Your mother wanted to bring children to Israel so that they could leave their ghettos .
"She pursed her lips , then clamped them together so tightly that I thought she was angry with me ."
He helped her meet people so she could go out and do the work she wanted .
There was a refugee who was able to come here because of her .
"At first I thought they were relatives of your mother , but it was not so ."
"He had the black numerals on his arm , so he had been branded in a concentration camp ."
Then he would walk off for a few days alone in the direction of Europe .
He loved the son and was always glad to be sent back to him .
"A few hours after the son was arrested , your mother was informed ."
She went to the father and found he had hanged himself '' .
"She said , `` Reuveni wanted your mother to give up her deep interest in this refugee ."
"When I did , she shrugged her shoulders and said that Reuveni wanted her to marry him ."
"I asked her if she would , and she said she would not ."
"Anyway , I did not see her until two weeks after the refugee hanged himself ."
He shouted at her and told her he loved her and couldn't understand why she had upset herself .
But now he was happy she would let him straighten out her life and take care of her .
`` Did I see him about to swing low in a chariot ? ?
Or maybe poling up the south fork of the Forked Deer River braving the wastes dumped in it ? ?
Maybe I saw him on a barge with a gang of Ethiopians poling it '' .
"Because if you can't then nobody else can either , nobody else can have him ."
You think : `` Did he feel that way about me '' ? ?
You wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of you .
It was like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano virtuoso rehearsing .
It was a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it .
"`` I should have stayed at the store '' , she thought ."
"The book could be The Brothers Karamazov , but it would still have the same jacket illustration ."
"I said , `` Mr. McKenzie , it is as authentic as careful research can make it '' ."
"He said , `` That may be , but it isn't authentic the way readers think ."
And girls couldn't have dressed like that -- it isn't transparent enough '' .
"he sold perhaps three or four a year , and usually all to Joyce Monmouth or her friends ."
"He had style , a real inner vision of his very own ."
We used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted .
"He also had , at times , an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker ; ;"
"It was all gravy , and Donald didn't need much to live on ; ;"
He was fifteen years older than I -- forty-four -- but full of spring and sparkle .
He was one of the most prominent magazine illustrators in America ; ;
"Like certain expensive restaurants , just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself ."
"In the course of our talk , Askington mentioned that he spent part of each week studying ."
"`` No , I take classes with different people '' , he said ."
"It is as large as all of art , interdependent , varied , multitudinous '' ."
"Ah , what a title for the exhibition : The Eye is All '' ! !"
"Still painting , still a kind of modern impressionist , beautiful canvases of mountains and farms ."
"It was mostly for the benefit of the mailman , because hardly anybody else ever visited us ."
I don't know that it was always as rewarding as I had expected it to be .
"`` Via must have it '' , I answered readily enough , recalling her last visit ."
`` I drive my own car by courtesy of Via '' ? ?
"`` I'm sure she'd turn it over to you , if you'd rather ."
`` She must have taken the registration when she went to Walter's .
"Walter was giving me checks for my pay , the household bills ."
Had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped her mind ? ?
`` It narrows down down down and finally there is no way out .
If I am not to be Mrs. Salter I am nothing '' .
And I went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch of life .
Dolly Engisch was waiting there on the steps and she came running toward us .
"She screamed , and both women ran up to the house , and I followed ."
"It was Dolly and Mrs. Thaxter who were calling Via , everybody ."
And when they spoke they spoke to each other and not to me .
Sitting in the kitchen I recalled every word Mrs. Salter said that could have been a sign to me .
`` If I am not to be Mrs. Salter then I am nothing '' .
"I had made a habit of calling her at night from my cottage , just to check ."
"The last night I had called , but the line was always busy and it reassured me ."
"I assumed it was one of those hour-long conversations with Dolly or Constance , she comfortable in bed ."
"Then was it a final desperate plea from her , to whom ? ?"
Hanging on and on past any man's patience some final stab of conclusion ? ?
She was found the day after at the bottom of the cliff .
"But I didn't really think it was as simple as that , nor did anyone else ."
Was it a hysterical release from the long strain of vigilance of those weeks ? ?
Even now I am appalled at how little anyone knows of what they really are .
"No , I forget Mrs. Mathias , who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened ."
she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised Mrs. Salter to return to the country .
"`` We all feel guilty '' , I turned away from her coldly ."
`` Why put such a high value on being top dog '' ? ?
"She was finally at rest in truth , of her own proud free choice ."
"Again I felt impelled to kneel , and reached back and pulled Via down ."
Something would come into her heart if nothing else the sounds of Bach would give her some healing .
A nice bachelor apartment in a place called the Lancaster Arms '' .
"`` Uhhu '' , she said , hardly listening as she studied her left eyelid ."
`` And then I had another place farther downtown I used as a studio '' .
But I think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with '' .
"Pausing , he waited for her to turn , to ask a question ."
`` Somehow I imagine that as you grew up you were alone a lot .
"`` I guess so '' , she said taking a Kleenex from her purse ."
"He asked , trying to touch a part of her life Alberto hadn't discussed ; ;"
"`` You talk so well , Carla '' , he went on ."
"You know something more about me every day , don't you ? ?"
"Would you be happier if I made up some stories about my life , told you some lies ? ?"
"At home he had been a clean orderly man , and now he had to hide his annoyance ."
Was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance ? ?
"He straightened up , ready to vent his exasperation , then grew afraid ."
"`` Are those the only shoes you have , Sam '' ? ?"
"`` I'll get an elegant pair of thin-soled Italian shoes tomorrow , Carla '' ."
Can't you wear something else and look a little more as though you belonged '' ? ?
"`` I don't mind at all '' , he said , delighted with her attention ."
"That day they loafed around , just getting the feel of the city ."
She had some amusing scandal about the Farneses in the old days .
"It was a good thing that she clung to her religion , he thought ."
He wondered Probably because it was a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security .
"As for himself , he just didn't have the temperament for it ."
Then he thought of those Old Testament figures on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel .
"Or a Protestant , or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists , or a strict orthodox Communist ."
What was the matter with him that they all wearied him ? ?
"And he waited for her to say , `` Oh , no , I can do it , Sam ."
"Let's be fine superior people of great dignity '' , he said as if he were joking ."
"When they walked into the Ferraro apartment , the old lady , bowing and smiling , said softly ."
"Acting only as interpreter Carla , her hands folded on her lap , was utterly impersonal ."
"She would turn to them , then turn to him , then turn again ."
"Signora Ferraro , bobbing her head encouragingly , asked Sam about Canada , having a special interest ."
For a year the boy had lived in the bush in a boxcar .
Did many of Sam's countrymen live in boxcars in the bush ? ?
"A very great Pope , this one , the old woman explained , her black eyes sparkling ."
"Agnese had been sitting quietly , listening with the serenity of the unaware ."
Now a little flush came on her pale homely face and enchantment in her eyes .
"Yes , the Pope could die and quickly be made a saint ."
"Nodding approvingly and swelling with importance , the old lady whispered confidentially ."
"The Pope , in the splendor of his great intellect , had neglected them a little ."
"Indeed he did , Sam said solemnly , trying to get Carla's eye ."
"Surely she could see that these women were her Italians , too , he thought ."
"Devout , orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in Brooklyn or Malta or Ireland ."
"It's like a flame , I guess '' , she said in a dreamy tone ."
"His breath caught , and , trembling , he closed his eyes and stumbled off ."
"Then he fled , not waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry ."
"But the girl said only , `` Tell him I am here , that I have come '' ."
"`` Go take helsq'iyokom , your evil spirit , to the young boys '' , the woman said ."
They were all shouting at her as if she were the embodiment of the evil she brought .
"`` If you must flog someone , let it be her , your daughter ."
Drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband '' ! !
"But the old man turned on her , jerking the whip from her hand ."
`` Go back to that double-married man of yours who so parades his fine body among the young women .
"Keep him back , if you must tell me what to do ."
"She said to him , her father , `` How was I begotten , in pain or joy ? ?"
Is it for me to be forbidden the flesh you made grow on me ? ?
Move from the line or I will settle the whip on you .
"He said , `` Let me take her blows , for there are demons in me too '' ."
"He shouted like a hoarse old mastiff , his hair stiff and bristling ."
But they could taste the appeasement of violence and retribution through his antics .
"And a very young one , Swan Necklace , tried to emulate them and followed timidly ."
"All the young men , Alokut among them , challenged them in matched racing ."
"They raced and maneuvered for war , swinging their horses in single file and then abreast like cavalry ."
"Walitzee whitened his leggings with clay , knowing the girl watched from her place in the trees ."
"He was always aware of the women's eyes which followed him , admiring him ."
"And those of Early Spring , haunted and now full of hurt and envy ."
They would give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see their arrogance .
"young chief stared at the wall of his lodge , , listening ."
He saw them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across the ridge .
"She was moving through a screen of hemlocks , in among the white birch and maples ."
"She felt as if some dark , totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at her arm ; ;"
Julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and clasped her hands tightly around the bent knees .
"Perhaps it was because it was so late , and because she had no business to be here now ."
He was staring at the blue china lamp left on beside him .
It seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch ; ;
but of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this Monday morning .
"Well , he told himself , let's put the show on the road ."
He drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with both hands .
He found a lump rising in his throat because of that one simple act of tidiness .
Alex Poldowski -- in a fashion he owed a debt to that effete gentleman .
He rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of the closet door .
"He was supposed to be in court this afternoon , at City Hall ."
"`` Well , at least you won't have to do that '' , she was saying ."
Her face seemed to float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight .
"`` Well , won't you come in then , have a cup of coffee -- or something ? ?"
"She asked , in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated , considerate , and yet perhaps partly scornful ."
"`` No -- nothing at all '' , he said after a moment's hesitation ."
"Pietro was gazing at him in an insolent , disdainful fashion ; ;"
To the manner born -- odd to have such a thought at a time like this ; ;
"Carrie seemed more affectionate , but obviously Julia had respected his request ."
`` Are you positive you'll be all right by yourself '' ? ?
He had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it .
"Just one or two swallows , he told himself , enough to lessen some of the pain ."
"Yes , sure , I'll see the doctor -- this evening , if you insist ."
"Unfortunately it turned out to be me , but I wouldn't quite put it that way to the boss ."
He'll understand -- you might give him sort of a tactful nudge .
I wouldn't want to ask for a postponement -- it's really just a routine thing .
"She let him come and go as he pleased , or as it pleased her ."
In the office you might have thought them only casual friends ; ;
"It wasn't just the obnoxious birds that had ruffled her own feathers , of course ; ;"
"It was Jim's `` little '' sister Myra , the unreliable , irresponsible , forever flyaway , Myra ."
"`` Come , come '' , Jim said , jollying Lucy a little ."
"Upstairs , busy feet , showering like raindrops , pattered around her room ."
"`` Darling '' -- she said , and the single word mingled love and exasperation in an equal blend ."
"Leaving Cathy with them , Myra had gone out to the Coast for a supposedly brief visit ; ;"
"but she had stayed all winter , and Cathy had stayed all winter too -- with them ."
"For an otherwise silent moment , Jim's keys jingled nervously in his pocket ."
"`` But she promised -- This will be different '' , he said at last ."
And not for one moment did she believe that Myra had settled down .
"Remembering that succession of disasters , she now considered Cathy , an ominous child-cloud on her horizon ."
"He went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up , fiercely , `` Susan ! !"
"Their arms around each other , they had been talking of the present and the future ; ;"
"Then , from within the still , sleeping house , the telephone had rung ; ;"
"Myra , with her news , was on the other end of the line ."
"His dark brows , which had been lowered in anger , smoothed ."
`` There isn't a chance of Myra's letting anything like that happen .
"they were husband and wife , and Myra had no right muddling and chilling their marriage ."
"The only thing that had ever come between them was that worthless , selfish sister of his ."
"`` Well , at last '' , she said , because Susan was clattering down the stairs ."
Susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes that gushed an instant grief ; ;
"to her , each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart ."
"`` Now , now '' , Lucy said , approaching Susan with a handkerchief , mopping skillfully ."
"And when you get back from Grandma's , Cathy will be here to play with you ."
"`` No '' , Susan said , grappling with her outsized armload of dolls with a Scrooge-like effect ."
"That was one more reason she didn't look forward to Cathy's visit , short or long ; ;"
She suspected that Cathy had been competing with Susan for attention that she had never had .
"The day was brilliant around her -- flower-scented , crisp with breeze -- yet her inner turmoil darkened it ."
"She had let Jim go with a chilly good-by , a chillier kiss ."
"She was sorry , and angry at herself , because never in their life together had she done that ."
It isn't only birds that dump their children in other people's nests .
"In the sunshine of late afternoon , Lucy stood looking at the ready guest room ."
A row of little hangers waited for a child's clothes in the neatly empty closet ; ;
Many times since his death that memory had worried and troubled her .
"Out in the hall , the upstairs phone shrilled , and the small ghost vanished ."
"When she picked up the receiver , her mother's cheerful voice was there ."
"Myra dropped Cathy this morning , and Jim picked Cathy up and left Susan a few hours ago ."
"she relaxed a little , and some of the tension went out of her ."
"You could think yourself as grown up as Methuselah , yet the maternal voice still kept its comforting magic ."
"`` Just for a couple of weeks , till Myra finds a place for them '' ."
"Once the soft , pretty moth found the bright light she had always wanted ? ?"
"Suddenly , seekingly , Lucy asked , `` Mother , do you know something I don't know '' ? ?"
"Again there was that curious pause , and then her mother said , `` I guess I do ."
"She hesitated , as though hunting over words and ways of putting them ."
"Then she jumped to her feet , the elastic phone cord uncoiling like a black snake ."
Myra had no intention whatever of sending for Cathy in two weeks .
"For Lucy , the day's nagging to-and-fro had come to an abrupt end ."
"Cathy is tired , Lucy thought , watching them come slowly up the path ."
"She trudged along slowly , both hands clutching a tired teddy bear ."
Nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping jaggedly to the water's edge .
His rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here .
"( One good thing about a suit of armor , his leg wouldn't show ."
") He was the first astronaut on the moon , chosen because of his small size and intrepid nature ."
"It happened two weeks ago , the night before his father left on a business trip to South America ."
"and when he woke up , his father was saying , `` Stop screaming , Quint ."
"While I'm gone you get brown and fat as a pig , hear ? ?"
"Look , I can put two fingers between the cords in the back of your neck ."
In the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the promise spilled out .
"She called him `` Stuck-up -- that's why nobody plays with you , Mister Stuck-up '' ."
He unlaced his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg .
He wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks .
"He stood on the rock , a skinny , dignified boy surrounded by the ocean ."
"And shivering with shame , he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat into the water ."
"`` Watch it , big shot '' , a hoarse voice yelled back ."
"She wore a bathing suit like his mother's , no straps on the shouders ."
"`` I can speak both kinds of Latin , smart aleck '' ."
"`` You shouldn't smoke so much '' , he said , unconsciously imitating Victoria's holier-than-thou voice ."
"`` If I was your mama , I'd wop your tail off '' ."
`` Why don't you paint it red and white like a barber pole '' ? ?
"`` Holy mackerel , that's the most unique dog I ever saw '' , she said firmly ."
"`` His real name's DiMaggio , only we call him Maggie because he has to take tranquilizers ."
"Even though this is my rock , you can use it sometimes ."
"Same time , early , before the fog burned off , because she didn't like the sun ; ;"
He's got a long beard and picks his teeth with a fork .
Near Galway the tinkers drove their caravans down to the beach and sang and drank and fought all night .
"As for dancing -- holy mackerel , he ought to see the gypsies in Jerez ; ;"
they danced on the sand till your blood got hot and danced with them .
"She made better pictures than any book he'd read , but he didn't say so ."
that his baby sister could spit up through her nose when she felt like it ; ;
( `` What did one tonsil say to the other tonsil ? ?
Let's get dressed up -- the doctor's taking us out tonight '' .
And `` What time did the Chinaman go to the dentist ? ?
) Encouraged by her giggles he imitated Maggie who was crazy about ham .
"He described the ham decorated with pineapple and cherries , cooling on the porch ."
"`` Say , you're quite a comic '' , Sabella said admiringly ."
But it was such a nice thought that he nodded his head .
"`` Better make up your mind , son '' , Sabella said ."
`` You can always tell a real gentleman -- they got a certain je ne say quok '' .
"As for his promise -- oh , he had plenty of time , buckets of time ."
"Same old breakfast till the phone rang , making his mother's voice shake with excitement ."
It had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung .
"Linda looked remote yet lovely in black , and everyone held his or her breath ."
Wasn't John Cooper even more attractive at forty-seven than he had been twenty-five years earlier ? ?
"And wasn't John's wife , Edythe , even more appalling , if possible ? ?"
"Didn't John Cooper , after all this time , deserve something better of life ? ?"
Wasn't it adult and realistic to look at it that way ? ?
"Then there was a spat over something , as there had been lovers' spats before ; ;"
"There was nothing specifically wrong with Edythe , but there was absolutely nothing right about her either ."
`` I know she gives the impression of being shallow and frivolous and scatterbrained .
"She is frivolous and scatterbrained , but she really isn't shallow '' ."
Edythe settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example .
Her hair never seemed to be in place and her skirts were never quite the correct length .
Mousie said it was because he was too proud to stand pity .
"John's mother died not long after his marriage , and there was even less Cooper money left ."
John sold the big old place in Sewickley and bought a smaller house in Fox Chapel .
"She never could fit into a crowd which had known , which still knew and admired Linda ."
after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company .
"The Coopers saw Bobbie and Linda socially , but no more than was necessary ."
"And then came the hairpin turn , the smashed Jaguar and Linda , mourning alone and lovely ."
"`` Now you know she could've , but she isn't that kind of girl ."
"But now -- well , it would be a blessing , I think ."
Linda Evans felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed Bobbie's death could move her to feeling .
It would be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of .
But what was a decent six months or so after the more than twenty years gone by ? ?
She was almost sick when Bobbie came home with the news that Poor John had won the job .
"Bobbie said something about damned Pittsburghers sticking together , and Linda got angry at him ."
"They had their first real fight , and Bobbie went off to get drunk ."
He was a director of S. & M. and must have been in on the decision .
He didn't tell her of the long board meeting where Bobbie and John were weighed one against the other .
"`` Now , I believe Poor John'll work just a little harder ."
"With that wife of his , I think he feels every chance he gets is his big chance ."
"Bobbie , with Linda behind him , will have plenty of other opportunities ."
`` Bobbie will take the job as his just reward and work hard at it ; ;
She called then to say she had a baby-sitter for that night .
Such a nice little thing -- lives right in the building '' .
It was past midnight and we were in bed when the phone rang .
"I stumbled through the hall , wondering who would be calling at this hour ."
"`` You scared me half to death '' , I said shakily ."
That stupid girl might have gone off and left Francie '' ! !
"We're at Ken Thom's apartment , and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat ! !"
"`` Janice , could you possibly go over and make sure everything's all right ? ?"
"Chris was sound asleep , and I didn't see any sense in waking him ."
"I dressed in the kitchen , then left a note on the table telling him what had happened ."
"`` It's all right '' , I said , as she started to look scared ."
I just came over to make sure everything was all right '' .
`` I didn't know it was going to be this late '' ! !
I crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone .
"I told Nadine everything was fine , and that I'd be getting on home ."
"There was a ragged edge to her voice now , as if she'd been crying ."
You know how gossip of that sort spreads through an apartment building '' --
"Well , there wasn't any law that said I had to stay ! !"
"After I looked in at Francie , I went into the living room and waited ."
"I must have dozed off , because I came to with a start at the sound of voices ."
"I opened the door , and Wally stumbled in -- fast -- as if Nadine had pushed him ."
"He lurched and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on it , and was instantly asleep ."
"Nadine strode over to him , and her pointed nails raked across his face ."
"`` You stay out of this '' , she spat at me ."
`` He's ruined us -- do you hear me -- he's ruined us ! !
`` He told Ken to his face that he doesn't have what it takes to get a woman ! !
We're ruined and he's going to get out if I have to throw him down the stairs '' --
"In the state she was in , she could actually kill him ! !"
"`` Now you just take it easy , and I'll make you some tea '' --"
And we don't have any money -- we don't have a dime ! !
All we own is Francie's bedroom set and the televison-record player and we even owe on them .
I clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of filth .
"`` Well then , I'll get out '' -- But she looked uncertain ."
`` In the morning you and Wally can talk things out '' --
"I got her into bed , and sat with her until she had sobbed herself out ."
It was three o'clock before I figured it was all right to go .
Whether or not Wally lost his job was no concern of mine .
I snuggled up close to him -- loving him -- thankful for a man like him .
"Wally sat in our big chair , his hands between his knees , looking ready to cry ."
"`` I'd had all this trouble with the old man , that's why I drank so much ."
Seems that the kid Wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side .
"Mr. Thom had gotten Wally on the phone , and fired him ."
"`` I thought I'd smooth things over through Ken '' , Wally said miserably ."
`` And told him right to his face he'd never slept with a woman '' ! !
"`` Things may smooth over yet '' , Chris said , his nice lean face grave with honest concern ."
But I couldn't help thinking that Nadine and Wally were getting just what they deserved .
"Worst of all , Wally had no training for any kind of work ."
"He had fallen into a soft job , and now the job was gone and he was stranded ."
`` I wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide them over '' .
"It was easy enough to say it , because of course we couldn't spare a cent ."
"It was incredible -- He gave me an embarrassed , pleading look ."
But it would only be for a couple of weeks -- until they get straightened out '' .
Straightened out -- They'd had years of making all that money ! !
`` Nadine was always too good to live in a little house like this ! !
"Well , now she can sleep in the street for all I care '' ! !"
"`` That isn't like you , Janice '' , Chris said uncomfortably ."
The finance company took all their furniture -- and they didn't have a cent to their name .
"At least we'll eat , I thought grimly as I put all the food away ."
"When she wasn't crying , she was in our bedroom fighting with Wally ."
`` You're too lazy to go out and look for another job .
"But it couldn't go on forever -- A couple of weeks , Chris had said ."
I figured I could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks .
"But the two weeks dragged into three , and they were still with us ."
"`` You can get a job working in a grocery store , if nothing else '' ."
"`` By fall they'll be back in school '' , I'd say , trying to sound encouraging ."
"But the rest of it , the main part , wasn't based on logic at all ."
"For the thousandth time , I wished I'd chosen some nice , nine-to-five , five-days-a-week profession ."
"Actually , I shouldn't complain , I told myself in the shaving mirror ."
A profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at .
"I was lucky in lots of ways , no doubt about it ."
"She is a closed book , a picture I keep on my bureau , but never look at ."
"As usual , Gladdy's bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table ."
"Her first class wasn't until ten , but she always got up to have breakfast with me ."
"Oh , I knew that I couldn't give myself all the credit for her decision ."
"But once I was alone again , driving to the hospital , the heaviness returned ."
"If she and Pete were really getting serious , I'd have to do some hard thinking ."
Did he have a right to know the secret I'd kept from Gladdy all these years ? ?
The boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when I got to Fairview .
"There wasn't anything of special interest that morning , no one sicker than they should have been ."
"Seven is a women's floor and , as it happened , not very busy right then ."
"`` Got a new one in last night '' , he said ."
"`` I haven't seen her yet , but I hear she's a lulu '' ! !"
"The ward was a small one , four beds , kept reserved for female alcoholics ."
We didn't get many at Fairview and they were never pretty sights .
It was thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular charity ward .
"They'd cleaned her up some , of course , and she'd pretty much slept off her drunk ."
But there was something about her -- and I felt my lips forming a name .
"She looked about sixty , though I recalled that the chart gave her age as forty-four ."
"Her coarse hair was two-colored -- bleached blonde and its real , dirty gray ."
"Although quiet when they brought her in , she'd suddenly turned violent and had to be knocked out ."
"We'd keep her a day or two , and the AA people would talk to her ."
"But if she wasn't interested , she'd just go back to the same life she'd left ."
"I tell you , it took every ounce of control I had to be able to speak ."
"`` Now , Miss -- or is it Mrs. Bancroft '' ? ?"
"This was one time I'd have gladly broken my own rule , but habit was too strong ."
But those penetrating eyes -- I had to turn my head away .
I told Miss Groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining table .
One of my private patients was being admitted and I went in to see her settled .
"`` I've got the results on the Bancroft smear test '' , he said ."
`` Well '' -- I didn't -- I didn't ever want to see that woman again .
We'll do a D. and C. and get her permission for a hysterectomy .
"Maybe it's nothing , maybe it's intraepithelial or in situ -- can't take any chances '' ."
"`` If you can keep her here that long '' , Pete said wryly ."
"`` Groggins tells me she's started badgering already , wants to get out ."
"But she seemed to be dozing and in any case , we'd been talking in low tones ."
"`` I sure can't complain about the service in this place '' , she said ."
"There was something almost insulting in her tone , but I disregarded it ."
"`` I've just been talking to Dr. Michelson '' , I said ."
"Even if we do , you'll be out of here in a week , probably '' ."
"`` You shouldn't tell your little secrets outside of the patient's door '' , she said ."
Her little speech was totally out of character with the sort of person I thought she was .
"This was someone who'd come down in the world , I thought ."
"`` You haven't got cancer '' , I said as strongly as I could ."
"She could have found out my first name , of course -- that wouldn't be difficult ."
"But there was that something , some echo in the way she spoke ."
"She was watching me intently , a funny little half-smile on her lips ."
"`` What's the matter , Joe , you scared of me ? ?"
Think I'm going to make you introduce a drunk as your wife ? ?
The last thing I remember is a bar in San Diego '' --
"The way she spoke , her flat acceptance of her alcoholic blackout , made me shudder ."
You doctors are all alike -- all you want is to cut up people and what's the good ? ?
"Let her out , let her out -- that would be the solution , wouldn't it ? ?"
"What she'd said was true -- in all these years , she'd never asked for anything from me ."
"yielding-Mediterranian-woman- , she soothed me , and drew me deeper into her ."
The metal-tasting nitrogen made me wonder if I should remove the mouthpiece and suck in the sweet water .
"Perhaps if I took off the aqua-lung I could swim better , love my woman better ."
It was when I packed up what duds I had and went to Paris .
"It was no vacation , just me getting out after a bellyfull ."
"Wild kicks never are , but I hoped to dig up a better frame of mind ."
"Once before I had been to Paris , long before I married Valery ."
"All the women were beautiful , and the men were equal to them ; ;"
I didn't know a human could feed so fast and still be beautiful .
"She was blonde , and young , and nice and round in a tight white dress ."
Maybe her ravenous eating wasn't grotesque because she was so positive about it .
"`` Madame '' , I said with noblesse oblige because of the `` handsome '' -- `` yeah '' ."
"Now it was nine years later , and it wasn't spring but winter when I returned ."
I sat waiting for Life to come along and sweep me up .
"After a few hours , Life hadn't showed , and I was crocked ."
All that day and Monday I drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space .
I was turning over the idea of a good debauchery when I dozed off .
There was dignity and beauty in the little white flakes falling through the blue night .
Pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick .
"She saw me and sat down beside me , three feet away ."
"She was silent for a while , then said , `` Why are you so unhappy '' ? ?"
"`` I'm not unhappy '' , I lied , staring at the snow ."
"She was trying to make a hole in my armor , and I didn't want it ."
"`` Ah , Monsieur , it is not my business to wager it ."
"I felt my frozen sad face crumble , and I grinned a silly one I couldn't have helped ."
"She smiled at me , but it was an awfully sad smile ."
"`` I'm sorry I haven't got a glass '' , I said ."
"It's really rotten to drink good cognac like that , but I hadn't cared before ."
"There wasn't much light in the blue dark , but I could see her well ."
"No child , this tart , she must have been thirty-five or even forty ."
"Not good looking , but self-confident and wise so that it made her attractive ."
"I liked her , and all at once I was glad she was there ."
We undressed and made love with the comfortable acceptance I had once known with Valery .
"She had a funny little scar on her stomach , on the left side ."
"I was hungry as a wolf , and my body felt lean and vital ."
"`` Bon jour '' , I said brightly , sitting up , which pulled the covers to her hips ."
"She looked good , with her short tousled hair and no make-up ."
"She came out pink from a hot bath , and I gave her my robe ."
"I had brushed my teeth , showered , shaved and dressed by the time a waiter wheeled in breakfast ."
I wondered if I ought to go use the new one myself .
"The coffee wasn't very hot though , made in a filter pot , but it was good ."
We sat back comfortably on the bed with our last cups of coffee .
"`` You are very tactful , do you know , Stephen '' , she remarked ."
"`` Yes , because you didn't run off to use that new toothbrush '' ."
"She smiled all the way to her wise , sad eyes , and drained her own ."
It was like a long thin line drawn through a pink circle .
"We went to the Louvre for a few hours , then by Metro to a cabaret in Montmartre ."
"The sommelier brought the wine first , a magnum instead of the bottle I had ordered ."
"I fixed him with a steely eye and said , `` What's this for ? ?"
Two letters had arrived for Miss Theresa Stubblefield : she put them in her bag .
"So here it was , here was Italy , anyway , and terribly noisy ."
"Glad to be alone , Theresa climbed the splendid outdoor staircase that opened to her left ."
Something special was going on here just now -- the annual display of azalea plants .
"In Rome , all over Europe , she intended to move very slowly indeed ."
"Theresa sat with her letters in her lap , breathing Mediterranean air ."
A few moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had contracted with anxiety and dismay .
"Of course , one of them would have to go and do this ! !"
And how on earth did I ever get this letter anyway ? ?
She had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her .
"This letter would have got to me if she hadn't even put Rome , Italy , on it ."
"All the fine old stock was dying out , look at the world today ."
A life of gentility and principle such as Cousin Elec had lived had to be known at first hand .
"Together with her mother , both of them tense with worry lest things should somehow go wrong ."
There they all did their uttermost to help Cousin Elec get a cramp out of his foot .
`` I hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up I'll just have to ! !
"`` You might treat it like the hiccups '' , said Papa ."
"`` Of course ( George's letter continued ) , there are practical problems to be considered ."
Cousin Emma is alone in that big old house and won't hear to parting from it .
) `` I hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them .
"I'll start sneezing in a minute , sitting on these cold steps ."
"Yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome , and felt themselves to be so ."
He knew how to spread himself against the borders of the space that had to separate them .
"Carrozza rides in the park , the Colosseum by moonlight , he specialized ."
"Theresa turned away to escape , and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two ."
"The lady with the alligator bag registered interest , doubt , then indignation ; ;"
She cast about as though looking for a policeman : this really shouldn't be allowed ! !
They would not care if all of Europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow .
"She arranged the letters carefully , one on top of the other ."
"Then , with a motion so suddenly violent that she amazed herself , she tore them in two ."
I knew it as surely as everybody in Westfield -- that Lucille was a husband stealer .
"Just as it has its Susan Dolan , though nobody'd ever bothered to tell me that ."
I asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck .
"Honest , kitten , that's all it is -- I don't even like Lucille much '' ."
"His smile was quick , and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp ."
"The most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me , too ."
He was too honorable to leave his wife penniless and leave those helpless children without their daddy .
But the only love I was giving him was the pure kind .
"Against my folks' wishes , we'd been seeing each other for short rides in the truck ."
"Yet even then we did nothing much but talk , and maybe neck a little ."
`` And never show my face or my truck around here again '' .
"At first , Johnnie hadn't understood -- how could he , not being a religious person like me ? ?"
"But what had I done , trying to keep us pure ? ?"
I had just the same as delivered him into the hands of the Devil ! !
"Outside , in the summertime fields behind the motel , a thousand crickets serenaded us ."
It was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever experienced .
"I took great comfort from his words , and smiled to myself in the darkness ."
I felt no conflict between what I was doing and my strict religious upbringing .
Wouldn't Johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness ? ?
It was only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might bring .
A chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow .
I wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group .
"He looked very different from Johnnie -- in fact , he looked sort of like me ."
"I thought so , and he mentioned it , and Alma said so too ."
"After the meeting , there was going to be a party at someone's house ."
"`` Hey , there , beautiful twin of mine '' , Ronald said ."
"By the time we arrived , the party was already going strong ."
A couple of the girls were laughing rather shrilly and I realized they were drinking .
I hadn't liked it at first -- it was bitter and burning .
"But when Johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale , I enjoyed it ."
Of course I enjoyed 'most anything if I did it with Johnnie .
Johnnie I suddenly realized he'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening .
"He looked around his little Eden : bureau , bed , table , chair , two-burner stove ."
"In the cold light of day , it seemed a lunatic arrangement ."
She had explained it -- something about summer people's eating out and not enough space in the units .
"He remembered seeing it last night , when he put away his small store of bachelor-type eatables ."
"This vacation had seemed like a good idea last week , when his doctor had prescribed it ."
The others will make you a little more comfortable until you get it licked .
"You young men get to be my age , you won't take flu so lightly '' ."
"He had caught , too , like an ailment , a confirmed distrust of women ."
"Once burned -- scalded , really , because Vivian had given him every encouragement -- forever shy ."
"In these damp circumstances , he was an odds-on bet to develop pneumonia ."
"He looked up to see Mrs. Kirby , awesome in a black-and-yellow polka-dotted slicker , bearing down on him ."
"Charlie forbore to mention that the wet was somewhat universal , Peony being less than weatherproof ."
"Everything being the sweater , a lipstick case , and a squirt bottle of Kissin' Kare pink hand lotion ."
"The note paper was pink , too , and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine ."
"but on the other hand , he didn't want her swiping his salami ."
"But then , as he well knew , women are not guided by logic or common sense ."
"They would be black or white or horse-blanket plaid , chic and splashy , like Vivian herself ."
`` Why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator '' ? ?
"You want to watch out that you don't get burned to an ash , first sunny day ."
I must remember to warn the girl next to you in Larkspur .
"He could hear Mrs. Kirby now , warning her pale guest against sunburn ."
"`` I spoke to the fellow next door , too '' , she might say ."
"Clearly , two damp days with the Bobbsey Twins had done him no good ."
"The sun , blazing hot as prophesied , was far from kind to Mrs. Kirby's varicolored properties ."
"He could not imagine a flower's being brave enough to grow beside Peony , Larkspur , and the rest ."
"No wonder she was so pale , wearing all those cold clothes ."
He had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper .
"There were pink bathing suits on blondes , and browny-haired girls in red or black or green bathing suits ."
There were a sprinkling of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits .
"Finally , in desperation , he opened the refrigerator , filched her hand lotion , and left a note ."
"Now Vivian , for instance , was not too long on sympathy ."
"She felt , and said , that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves ; ;"
"it was a tough world , and you had to be tough to hold your own ."
"He didn't know what was so tough about Vivian's world , slopping around Nassau with what's-his-name ."
"She might peel him , once the worst of the agony was over ."
"`` I'm not that anxious , but maybe that's why you're so fair '' ."
There was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot .
The new Riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that took a hop .
"Eddie Lee , Riverside's redheaded playing manager , ran after the ball but it rolled past him ."
Phil Rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the relay .
Eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to Phil .
Phil spun around and made an accurate throw into Mike Deegan's hands on third base .
Mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag .
He came into the bag with his body and Mike Deegan brought the ball down full in his face .
Mike Deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher .
"This brought in everybody from both sides , while the spectators stood up and added to the uproar ."
When the inning was over he cursed the Anniston catcher all the way into the dugout .
"Phil Rossoff , coming in from left field , stopped at the water fountain for a drink ."
He was eyeing the Anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before the inning began .
Phil Rossoff said : `` Why don't you leave him alone '' ? ?
"He stepped into the dugout , wondering why Deegan was always looking for trouble ."
"All Deegan had to do was slide , fall away , but instead , he rammed into the catcher ."
"He went back to touch home plate , turned and walked to the dugout without looking back ."
"Phil Rossoff , seated next to Deegan , got up and moved to the other end of the bench ."
The Anniston manager came right up to the dugout in front of Mike .
"`` Deegan '' , the manager said , his voice pitched low , quivering ."
The game started again and in the eighth inning Mike Deegan came up to bat .
The first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for Mike's head .
He got back into the batter's box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again .
When he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in .
Mike Deegan pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat .
"He stood flat-footed in the box , but not very close to the plate now ."
The pitcher wound up and the ball came in straight for Mike's head .
Mike and the Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together .
Phil Rossoff and two other Riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started .
"After the game , Phil was taking off his sweatshirt in the dressing room when Mike Deegan came in ."
Mike had a good two inches over Phil and Phil had to look up into Mike's face .
"`` I didn't ask you to fight for the ball club '' , Phil said slowly ."
But before anything could happen Frankie Ricco was between them and Eddie Lee had come into the dressing room .
"`` The best thing for you to do '' , Eddie said , `` is go home ."
`` Now don't tell me what a good ball player you are .
But what you haven't got is the heart to back up that talent with .
"You just haven't got the heart for pro-ball , and that's it '' ."
I tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win -- you won't do it .
"`` I think you're wrong , Eddie '' , he said finally ."
"Phil turned and left the room , hearing Eddie say : `` Someday you'll see I was right '' ."
"Outside in the dressing room , Frankie Ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes ."
Then Frankie said : `` What are you gonna do '' ? ?
Phil started to take his clothes off and Frankie sat down on the bench again .
"He just didn't know what he was talking about , saying a thing like that ."
His broad reading took him into certain by-ways of religion and the subject of religion began to fascinate him .
"He was enormously happy with her gift and smiled , then went to his room to read ."
"Through quiet laughter his mother said , `` Don't speak to your father like that , Richard '' ."
Richard seldom spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about religion again .
`` Do you still have The Book of the Dead '' ? ?
"`` Yes '' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` I still have it '' ."
Then he sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried .
It was as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind .
"At one such gathering Charlotte announced , `` I was at Ryusenji today ."
"Soba , udon and tea were In because they could be taken noisily ."
"`` He wasn't the least bit disturbed by my watching him '' , said Charlotte ."
"`` Well I was able to do it '' , Charlotte said with no sign of irritation ."
`` There's a little place there called Lovers Mound dedicated to Gompachi and Komurasaki '' .
`` There was that fellow out there in the bitter cold '' --
"`` And the water would be still colder '' , Ceecee seemed to shiver at the thought of it ."
Richard's dark eyes came up and seemed for the tiniest moment to reflect sharp light .
"That night , after leaving Charlotte's apartment , Richard walked about for a time before returning to his room ."
He was surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which Charlotte had mentioned .
"On the hillside above was caged what might have been an incarnation of Fudo , or perhaps a demon ."
"He stayed home , reading and refusing to think about his frightening experience at Ryusenji ."
I almost ran over the snake before I could stop the tractor in time .
"Go out of the furrow , snake , I said , but it did not move at all ."
The eyes were clear and black and the slender body was arched slightly .
I had my back to the corner of the triangular field that pointed towards the house .
I was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on .
I stopped the tractor and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me .
"I looked closely at his eyes , and he was already innocent ; ;"
"`` No , you cannot '' , I said , pushing aside the water jar he offered to me ."
"`` Yes '' , he said , eagerly , beginning a kind of dance of excitement ."
`` They are ugly and they eat chickens and I hate snakes '' .
"`` You killed it because you wanted to kill it , for no other reason '' ."
"`` They're ugly and I hate them '' , the boy insisted ."
"`` It was beautiful '' , I said , half to myself ."
"The boy skipped along beside me , and he was contented with what he had done ."
"I'm sorry , I thought to the snake , for you were beautiful ."
`` I'm going to tell everybody how big a snake I killed '' .
He came up and was going to push at it with his heavy shoes .
"I could see the happiness in the boy's eyes , the gleeful brutality ."
"He looked up at me , puzzled , and he swayed his head from side to side ."
"Cady didn't come unglued easily , but this had not been a day of glad tidings ."
"This was the letter which would or would not enroll his son , David , in Hanford ."
His son who had never held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life .
"His son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor , lawyer , merchant or chief ."
"Look at Pete Alcorn , who hadn't missed a Hanford ball game in fifteen years ."
"Hanford College , Little Ivy League , had no room for football players with low grades ."
Good solid B average with a sprinkling of A's in math and science .
"David had the same gray eyes , high cheekbones , dark hair and a certain rugged ugliness ."
"`` His interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics , tennis and swimming ."
His chief motivation for enrolling at Hanford is the desire to '' --
"Mr. Partlow banged his fist on the keyboard , ruining the letter ."
He paced to the window and looked at the city he had helped to build .
What a production to make of a letter commending your own son ! !
He told Hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics .
He finished with a flurry of good wishes to Hanford College and signed the letter .
"Then he met the grave eyes of his wife , Anne , from the photograph next to David's ."
Better show it to Anne and see if he had omitted anything .
Yet the whole of Anne was something she had never learned in any college .
He whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he got on the elevator .
"`` You look like you just heard a real gasser , Mr. Partlow '' ."
"Cady looked at Tom , who had taken him up and down for fifteen years ."
"Now you have to be well rounded , firm in motivation and pre-packed with knowledge '' ! !"
"`` Oh '' , said Mr. Partlow , `` that's fine , Tom ."
"As he drove home through the thinning traffic , Cady felt the unease growing ."
"He hadn't told anyone , but he , too , had applied to five colleges for David ."
Nor did looking at Anne ease the tension as it usually did .
He liked her blond hair and the sprinkle of freckles across her nose .
From those navy-blue eyes she saw things as clearly and honestly as David did .
"I know it is midweek , but it's only eight days before commencement ."
"Carefully he put down his steak knife and said loudly , `` Mr. Chairman '' ! !"
Cady Partlow's head came up like that of the proverbial fire horse .
"Dave ate two pieces of pie as he did everything else , slowly , methodically and with interest ."
Dave shrugged on his sports coat and picked up the car keys .
Charles Burke got turned down by Dartmouth and he is a straight-A student '' .
"Anne said it wasn't surprising because Charles was antisocial , a lone wolf , and completely one-sided ."
"`` I can hardly say the same about you , Dave '' ! !"
"`` Girls , my dear parent , are here to stay ! !"
Anne waited until the door had slammed and picked up the coffeepot .
Cady trailed her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable book-lined room .
Your fur has been rubbed the wrong way and you show it .
"They want a letter from me on his motives , interests and leadership ."
"Cady handed her the letter , drank his coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence ."
He just took over the week Bill Daley was in the state basketball play-off '' .
"Geology , You and Dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the fishpond six years ago ! !"
"`` Just say he likes swimming , tennis , chess and music '' ."
`` But he plays bass with Chief Crazy Horse and his Five Colts '' ! !
Even in that he never solos like Jack on guitar or Rich on sax .
"Don't worry , Cady , he'll be back in the Beethoven fold by next year '' ."
But I refuse to be brutally honest and mention Chief Crazy Horse and his Five Colts '' .
Anne laughed and Cady felt the tension loosen its grip on the back of his neck .
"`` Maybe I am padding it a bit , Anne '' , he said ."
`` But you know how hard it is to get a boy into a good college .
`` Did you know he is advertising his ham-radio equipment for sale this weekend ? ?
Can you really say his motivation for college is electronics '' ? ?
Cady felt the jolt as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel .
For once Cady Partlow wished Anne would yell at him so he could yell back .
"`` I have talked to him , but you know I've never tried to push him into any profession ."
Anne picked up the towel she was hemming for the hospital guild .
"You want him to be a leader of men , like you '' ."
"Not the kind of leadership you mean , working with lots of people ."
You can't run a war with ninety-nine generals and one private '' ! !
"Cady walked the block to the mailbox , almost ashamed of himself for arguing with Anne ."
Martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist at all .
"Lying awake at night , he could see them , laid out on the floor of his mind ."
"When he rose in the morning , the image was still there ."
There was an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal to pick them up .
"He remembered the first time he saw her , standing across the room at a party ."
"The smooth curve of her neck , very white against hair which curled against it like petals ."
"So he sought her out , and spoke to her , and thought of his hand in her hair ."
All Martin thought he needed was time : to what better use could time be put ? ?
"There was too little occasion beforehand for resistance , the brave strong delights of emotional clash and meeting ."
It was on the tenth day after the wedding ( how could it have been so soon ? ?
"`` Now , I'm not going to pick up those shorts '' ! !"
"He smiled to himself , and decided not to mention them till Dolores did ."
For he had just remembered : tonight they were having their first guests .
The shorts would not be on the floor when he came home that evening .
"They gave the room a strange note of incongruity , like a mole on a beautiful face ."
"He saw that Dolores intended to wait until the last minute , thinking he would get nervous ."
"I can be as stubborn as she can , he thought ; ;"
"He swung around , eyes toward the bedroom , some fifteen feet away ."
"He could not cross the living room , brush past her , and bend down to retrieve the shorts ."
"With the most casual and relaxed manner in the world , Dolores led Anthea to the bedroom ."
Then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there .
Clearly she had been instructed `` not to say a word '' .
"For some reason , this ellipsis in the conversation spread until it swallowed up every other topic ."
"Martin realized , later on , that he should have `` had it out '' with Dolores that night ."
There was something about private feminine whisperings which always made him feel scabrous and unclean .
"He apologized so sweetly , I couldn't keep being annoyed with him '' ."
It wasn't even true that he'd said he was sorry that time ; ;
Here they were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by .
These stray people nearly always insisted on Dolores showing them around the apartment .
"With her eyes Dolores dared him for the truth , ready to begin : It's a little contest --"
Never again did he enter into the ritual of showing the apartment .
"In his moments of worst agony , Martin imagined what his friends were saying ."
"Six weeks of marriage and I'm using the past tense , he told himself furiously ."
"Pursuing his idea , he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now ."
Day and night Martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made for himself .
Martin guessed that Dolores would not be so eager to tell the next installment of her story .
"To his delight , her eyes focused at once upon the two garments ."
"Extending her fingers another inch , she caught up the shorts , and swiftly left the room ."
"She did not look at him , but he noticed that her face was flushed and her eyes unsteady ."
"As he relaxed that day , Martin realized how tense he had been these past weeks ."
"`` You know , I've got one of your cars at home ."
"As a prominent industrialist , you ought to be interested in his nibs' support group ."
"A rush of memory swept him back , and he forgot Cap ."
How did he start on such a ride to brief glory ? ?
"Willis listened patiently , and once in a while William was exposed to them at a family gathering ; ;"
"he generally heard Freddy's suggestions without interest , being absorbed by his own prospering concerns ."
Probably Mr. Willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his grandchildren .
Another factor must have been the eventual disposal of Willis' fortune ; ;
"Although not much desiring the account , he had been appointed advertising head of Zenith ."
"In the end , he said : `` I'm not enchanted by the proposition , sir ."
It's his expert opinion that the plant isn't well suited to what you have in mind .
"Missiles have thrown everything up for grabs , and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here ."
Can't you stay with what you have and wait till the dust settles '' ? ?
"`` Well '' , he said , `` there is Freddy , you know ."
I don't like to exhibit the deadly dampening effect of an elderly man's caution '' .
"I've caused him trouble before , and he's beginning to resent me ."
"`` One shouldn't mix commercial affairs with patriarchy , but in this case I have no choice ."
"I'm most grateful to you , so grateful I wish you were my principal aide instead of Freddy '' ."
"Not to William's surprise , Freddy , Adam and Hamilton Richert prevailed ; ;"
"He forgot about A-Z till , unhappily , he and Hamrick were proved correct ."
Freddy's backing dropped away from him and Mr. Willis was forced to make up the deficit .
"Confronted by a grim future , Freddy lost his nerve and plumped for a drastic liquidation ."
"Initially , Hamrick's reaction to A-Z going into the passenger car market was discouraging ."
"He was surprised and dubious , but impressed by the engineer and the report ."
"`` I should explain : there's more here for me than advocating my little dream , there's you ."
"From shock and incredulity , most of the listeners went on to open resistance and animosity ."
"`` It's absurd , Bill '' , Freddy said , from a pale face ."
"Sure , Ticonderoga went broke in the low-priced market bucking the Big Three ."
"Their cars weren't small enough , they didn't have the power , they were old-fashioned ."
We've all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age .
"We'll woo the consumer with a product , not bludgeon him with chromed excess length and weight ."
"Let's make it moonlight and the call of far places and a seduction , at reasonable rates ."
"We've got rid of the steam yachts and Georgian houses , and the bloated , too-expensive automobile is next ."
"Why not come down smartly in the world , in a chic fashion , with an Allstates-Zenith '' ? ?"
"`` Nobody will underwrite it , I'm telling you '' , Freddy said ."
"I'm not giving you a chance , Bill , but availing myself of your generous offer of assistance ."
"Sweat started out on William's forehead , whether from relief or disquietude he could not tell ."
"Across the table , Hamrick saluted him jubilantly with an encircled thumb and forefinger ."
`` I suppose I can never expect to call you ' General ' after that Washington episode '' .
It was among these that Hinkle identified a photograph of Barco ! !
"On their way , they stopped at every gas station along the main boulevards to question the attendants ."
The jail authorities -- attaching no particular significance to the episode -- offered Barco whisky to revive him ; ;
It was reported to Welch's office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide .
The suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test .
So he paid a call on Barco in his cell and began their chat by stating bluntly :
"But to Welch's chagrin , the police captain pooh-poohed Welch's credulity in Barco's confession ."
"Then , for the first time since his arrest , a glint of spirit lit Barco's eyes ."
He directed the cortege of autos to the sand dunes near Santa Monica .
"With greater precision he again paced off a location , this time a little more to the left ."
"Although it was a mere fragment of the victim's remains , it was enough ."
His elation grew as Barco's seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another .
The effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined .
"The incident , aside from reflecting on Welch's political career , had all but wrecked his home life ."
"In the first place , it was difficult for us to meet ."
"I couldn't invite Viola to our house , for Mother snobbishly refused to receive her ."
"When I arrived at Viola's I was shown , to my surprise , into the kitchen ."
"I was saved from making the decision as the phone rang , and the girls were upon me instantly ."
"I promised to illustrate the lecture , if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed ."
"Speaking into the phone again and recognizing the caller , I resumed my everyday voice ."
"I discovered that the girls had shrewdly vacated the kitchen , and were playing quietly in the living room ."
"Resolving to get something done , I started in on the dishes ."
Francesca and Herbert were among the few people we knew in Catatonia .
They had bought their house in Catatonia after investigating all the regions of suburbia surrounding New York ; ;
"they had chosen Catatonia because of its reputation for excellent schools , beaches , and abundance of names ."
Practically the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing `` names '' ; ;
"Anyone knows how a real , red-blooded woman would react to such a catastrophe ! !"
"Grazie was mean : quietly mean , and bitterly , unfunnily sarcastic ."
She it was who had looked to see if I was wearing shoes upon learning that I couldn't drive .
"Grazie had a small , slick head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast ."
"Like Herbert , they were all in communications : radio , television , magazines , and advertising ."
Each had developed a hair-trigger chuckle and the habit of saying `` zounds '' ! !
I never thought I'd live to hear people chuckle and say `` zounds '' ! !
They were `` sincere '' -- men of the too-hearty handclasp and the urgent smile .
"Could such unadulterated love , for a total stranger , be credited ? ?"
people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on `` Person to Person '' ; ;
"people who thought it was nice to be important , but not important to be nice ; ;"
"In my estimation , they were people who read Daphne du Maurier , and discussed Kafka ; ;"
"well , not discussed him exactly , but said , `` Kafka '' ! !"
"Becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime , I brought myself back to the tasks at hand ."
"Then , I remembered that the girls had had a banana for dessert every day for the last week ."
They're just something you're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast '' .
"Needless to say , I was furious at this unparalleled intrusion upon free enterprise ."
It was then that I availed myself of the rights of a citizen and declared the income tax unconstitutional .
"I was ready , like Portia , to present my own brief ."
Albert Einstein was quoted as saying : `` The workings of the woman's mind amaze me '' .
"Nor , as Manny said , had the notoriety done my career `` any good '' ."
"Needless to say , my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period ."
Such sweeping distractions are hardly conducive to `` Oscar '' winning performances .
") As for his private monies , they were rapidly dissipated in drinking , gaming and carousing ."
Letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter .
"Yet I adored this man , Letch Feeley , why , I cannot say ."
"Thanks to Letch Feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me , the notices were few and unfavorable ."
") The film was called The Diet of Worms , which I felt was just what Letch deserved ."
"It turned out to be a life of Martin Luther , of all things ! !"
Letch had returned from his debacle unrepentant and more badly behaved than before .
"Her reply stung me , but this was too important to let my hurt make any difference ."
The difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately .
"As a result , life had become a kind of continuous make-ready ."
"He had almost forgotten them , although they had played such an important part in his early dreams ."
They were constantly assuring you that you were one of the world's great guys .
Now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs in the picture .
Why in the world couldn't he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to ? ?
"It worried him , this inability to get the simplest things done in the course of a day ."
He would wake up in the middle of the night and fret about it .
Was it possible that as people grow older the nature of time changed ? ?
"Did men become perfectionists as they grew older , polishing , polishing , reluctant to let go ? ?"
During all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done .
"On some distant farm a rooster crowed and , far down the valley , an associate answered ."
He turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn .
He had made such a fuss about buying that second car that he knew he was vulnerable .
He piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall .
That was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand tools .
How in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall ? ?
"How did one attach anything to a stone wall , for that matter ? ?"
He sat down on an old box and focused on the problem .
Perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget .
"But then , when you stuck things into the holes , why didn't they come right out again ? ?"
How could anyone know what to do with an assortment like that ? ?
Then at least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on .
The only trouble was that he himself was tied up on the school job .
Nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going to be taken drunk .
Mr. Crumb would probably see him at Lodge Meeting the next night .
"If he was sober , which was doubtful , he'd have him get in touch with Mr. Crombie ."
then a couple of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an' I guess we're about through down here '' .
That ain't too bad 'ceptin' the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do nothin' '' .
"Instead of being depressed by this news , Mr. Crombie was actually relieved ."
At least the moment was postponed when he had to face the mystery of the power tools .
"As usual , Mrs. Crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion of cooking utensils ."
"`` Well '' , he said , `` got your man fixed up nice down there ."
He oughta be able to build a new house with all them contraptions '' .
`` I was just sayin' to him that I'm all ready now for anything else you want done '' .
"Doors that won't open , and doors that won't close and shelves and broken -- ''"
"`` But those are the things I built the workshop for '' , protested Mr. Crombie ."
"`` Those are the things I can do , now that I'm set up '' ."
"`` I've been waiting to get these things done for months '' , she said ."
Mr. Blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf above the kitchen sink .
"In common parlance they would be described as misses -- misinterpreters , misunderstanders , misdirectors and kindred misdeeds ."
Ambiguity of a non-repetitious kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself in .
Evidently Bill was another of those men who simply don't understand women .
Now would you care to have us say that you were misquoted in regard to it '' ? ?
They recall Byron's classic comment : `` I wish he would explain his explanation '' .
"Similarly , when a reporter once questioned Lincoln in cryptic fashion , Lincoln refused to make any further statement ."
The obscurity of politicians may not always be as innocent as it looks .
`` It took me five hours to write it that way '' .
The misplaced modifier is another species more honored in the observance of obscurity than in the breach .
"Now can you tell me who was drunk -- The man , his wife , or me '' ? ?"
"The `` wooden-leg '' gag of vaudeville , another standby of this sort , had endless variations ."
`` There's a man outside with a wooden leg named Smith '' .
Another stock vaudeville gag ran : `` Mother is home sick in bed with the doctor '' .
"When radio came in , it continued the misplaced modifier in its routines as a standard device ."
`` Do you see that pretty girl standing next to the car with slacks on '' ? ?
`` I see the girl but I don't see the car with slacks on '' .
Then there was the caterer's ad which read : `` are you getting married or having an affair ? ?
In news items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs .
"Apart from journalese and vaudeville gags , the anatomical is also found in jocular literature ."
Her first day at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctor's notes on an emergency case .
There are many grammatical misconstructions other than dangling modifiers and anatomicals which permit two different interpretations .
At the home of a gourmet the new maid was instructed in the fine points of serving .
"So she brought the fish in whole , and she carried a lemon in her mouth ."
Another specimen of such double-entendre is illustrated by a woman in a department store .
"She said to the saleslady , `` I want a dress to put on around the house '' ."
"The puzzled saleslady inquired , `` How large is your house , Madam '' ? ?"
This saleslady was a failure in the dress department and was transferred to the shoe department .
"When a customer asked for alligator shoes , she said , `` What size is your alligator '' ? ?"
"`` Oh , I'm so delighted to meet you '' , she gushed ."
"`` I may be back '' , he explained , `` and then again , I may not '' ."
"`` Yes , sir '' , she said , `` is that definite '' ? ?"
"Why , it's all right , isn't it , Mother '' ? ?"
`` It's only that I like to know where you go '' .
Indefinite reference also carries double-meaning where an allusion to one person or thing seems to refer to another .
A politician was approached by a man seeking the office of a minor public official who had just died .
The manager of a movie theater received a telephone call from a woman who was equally indefinite .
"`` Oh '' , said the woman , `` I've seen that picture already '' ."
Another brand of indefinite reference arises out of the use of the double verb .
"When a question contains two verbs , the response does not make clear which of them is being answered ."
"The moonlit night was made for romance , and he had been looking at her soulfully for some time ."
"Finally he asked , `` Do you object to petting '' ? ?"
"`` That's one thing I've never done '' , she said promptly ."
"He thought a moment , then inquired , `` You mean petted '' ? ?"
Replies to requests for character reference are notorious for their evasive double-entendre .
It would be hard to find anything more equivocal than : `` I cannot recommend him too highly '' .
"If you are thinking of giving him a berth , be sure to make it a wide one '' ."
"In the comedy of indefinite reference , it-wit occupies a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence ."
The speaker referred to the whiskey but his friend thought he meant the cold .
It-wit is a misnomer because it covers slips as well as wit .
It has identified itself with the very tension and terror it once did so much to alleviate .

"One day , the children had wanted to get up onto General Burnside's horse ."
They wanted to see what his back felt like -- the General's .
But this is a public park and it's a city ordinance that the statues cannot be crawled on '' .
"Arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said , `` Yes , sir '' ."
That had happened on the day when two other unusual things had occurred .
Arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; ;
"In matters of exact information , that kept her one step behind developments ; ;"
I know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn '' .
"Asked the children , whose reflexes and replies were invariably so admirably normal and predictable ."
Maybe that was why they were cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability of Arlene .
"`` Just you wait '' , advised Arlene , echoing the dialogue in a recent British movie ."
"And when they had got to their little lawn , they had had a most twirlingly magnificent time ."
Those were especially the ones that all other grownups laughed at loudest .
"She would sometimes even get a little hard on you , she took you so seriously ."
"`` Now , we're going to be like what General Burnside and his horse make us think of '' ."
The children looked at each other and sagged their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever .
"Then , Arlene threw herself backwards and wiggled in a way that was just wonderful ."
She held herself that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked .
She made General Burnside's horse's belly do so funny when it was upside down .
It all has something to do with General Burnside and his horse '' .
"His legs shook , and the shaking went right on up his body through his hips to his shoulders ."
"`` That's the General's horse '' , one of them cried out ."
"The other remarked , in a happy laughter , `` That's a funny old horse '' ."
"He never could keep still , even when he didn't move his feet ."
"All they could think of was to run around in circles , kicking their legs out ."
"Then , they said General Burnside was going to jump over his horse's head ; ;"
She also taught them to sing `` I wish I could shimmy like my sister Kate '' .
They also caught on a little bit on how to smile a lot without your lips trembling .
"`` It's perfectly understandable , Arlene '' , my mother said in a friendly way ."
"`` Arlene's a good girl '' , my uncle remarked to us ; ;"
"`` She really is a dear little thing '' , my mother agreed ."
and that action always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing .
"Also , when she had bitten off half of the small radish , she found the suspense unbearable ; ;"
and she would snatch the finger-held half of the radish out to where she could inspect it .
But the warm joy of her brown eyes was open to the general public .
`` I reached into that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress .
"As a matter of fact , this happened every four or five months ."
the two youngest in our family always had to be brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment .
"`` Tell Mr. Gorboduc what you're doing these days '' , my mother advised the children , ceremonially ."
There was an air of revolt about the children -- even irreverence for their own principles .
"This could be told chiefly from a sort of head-tossing and prancing , a horselike balkiness of demeanor ."
"Possibly , the coconut-containing dessert had brought up bitter problems of administration ."
"But , at the beginning , this stayed just in the air ."
"`` We go to the park with this nice lady '' , one of them said ."
One of the children maneuvered out of range of the poking index finger .
He was so long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her sherry for dregs .
"Usually , this was done when attention was diverted by someone else's long , boring story ."
`` Tell me -- what do you do at the park '' ? ?
"This was delivered in a forthright way , without coyness and over-pretended interest -- an admirable way with children ."
"Only , unfortunately , he could not remove from his voice a nagging insinuation of the direct command ."
She laughed a little and tossed the dregs rakishly around in her glass .
